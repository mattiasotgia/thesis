\chapter{Validating the automatic Pandora-based reconstruction}\label{chap:methods}

The Pandora-based event reconstruction pipeline, as described in \autoref{sec:TPC_reco_gen}, has been --- and continues to be --- central to the physics analyses conducted with the ICARUS detector. Its use across the LArTPC community ensures it is a set of tools that is actively developed. Any improvement made by each collaboration sharing this tool is thus an improvement that can be exploited on all the experiments that use it.

The ICARUS collaboration...
