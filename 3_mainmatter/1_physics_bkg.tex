\section{Neutrinos, an history journey}

Dating back to 1914, the history of neutrinos began with the first paper published by Sir James Chadwick \cite{chadwickIntensityDistributionMagnetic1914}, who, investigating the phenomena of beta decays, discovered that the emitted electron energy spectra was not a single vertical emission line (delta shaped) but a continuous spectrum. 

The $\beta$ decay process, up until then, was thought to be just the emission of a single electron from a neutron decaying at rest to a proton, $\Pn \to \Pp + \Pem,$ and so it was expected the electron to carry all the neutron energy. A continuous $\Pem$ spectrum broke this expectation. W. Pauli in 1930 proposed the idea that the emission of the electron occurred along with the emission of another fermionic particle, far less massive --- massless even --- than the electron, carrying no electric charge \cite{pauliDearRadioactiveLadies1978} $\Pn \to \Pp + \Pem + \PAGne$. Though not calling this particle ``neutrino'' yet, its idea was all contained in Pauli's letter.

Enrico Fermi, a prominent scientist of that era, developed Pauli's idea, calling this new particle \emph{neutrino} \cite{fermiTentativoDiTeoria1934, fermiVersuchTheorieVStrahlen1934} --- from \emph{neutron}, the only chargeless particle discovered so far, aside from photons --- adding the suffix \emph{-ino}, meaning smaller (and lighter). Fermi's idea was the first \emph{field theory} of quantum mechanics, suggesting that the $\beta$ decay was to be formalized as a four-fermion point interaction, involving a neutron decaying to a proton to produce an electron and a neutrino, \begin{equation}
    \beta^-: \quad \Pn \to \Pp + \Pem + \PAGne. \implies 
    \feynmandiagram[baseline=(current bounding box.center), horizontal=a to b, scale=0.85]{
        a [particle=$\PAGne$] -- [fermion] e,
        c [particle=$\Pn$] -- [fermion] e,
        e -- [fermion] b [particle=$\Pp$],
        e -- [fermion] d [particle=$\Pem$] 
    };
    \label{eq:fermi_4p}
\end{equation}

Fermi's effective theory was able to explain the $\beta$ decay energy spectrum of the electron successfully, even preserving the angular momentum conservation. The value of the coupling measured by Fermi for this interaction, called $G_F$, was \begin{equation}
    G_F^{(\beta)} \simeq \SI{1.166e-5}{\per\giga\electronvolt\squared}, 
\end{equation} implying that this type of interaction was minimal, which justified calling this type of interaction \emph{weak}. Up until now, however, the neutrino was yet to be ``directly'' observed. It took twenty-six years of experimental efforts to actually detect the traces of this ``ghostly'' particle. The first experimental observation of electron antineutrinos produced by beta decays from the Savannah River reactor happened in 1956; a team led by F. Reines and C. L. Cowan observed the signature of inverse beta decay process (IB) \begin{equation}
    \PAGne + \Pp \to \Pn + \Pep
\end{equation} in a water tank, detecting the two gamma rays from proton annihilation in water with a liquid scintillator \cite{cowanDetectionFreeNeutrino1956}. 

The world of particle physics was discovering new particles very fast and putting together the picture we today know as the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics: in the same years the electron neutrino was discovered, a team led by Carl D. Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer was discovering the muon by looking at charged particles in the atmosphere, which they described as a heavier relative to the electron, since it showed a less prominent curvature than the electron when passed through a magnetic field; this discovery was later confirmed \cite{andersonCloudChamberObservations1936, neddermeyerNoteNatureCosmicRay1937, streetNewEvidenceExistence1937}. 
The discovery of the muon led to many starting to question about the relationship that neutrinos had with muons and electron.
In 1959 Bruno Pontecorvo examined this problem and questioned himself the nature of neutrinos \cite{pontecorvoElectronMuonNeutrinos1991}: are neutrinos produced alongside electrons and neutrinos produced alongside muons the same?. This led to the neutrino experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) guided by L. M. Lederman, M. Schwarz, and J. Steinberger. At BNL, using the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), protons were accelerated toward a beryllium target: the resulting kaons and pions decayed in-flight, producing muons and muon antineutrinos.  Using a spark chamber located behind a concrete wall stopping the produced muons, they were able to detect the muon produced by the interaction of muon antineutrinos but saw no electron-like event. This constituted a valid proof that there are at least two \emph{families} of neutrinos. 

In 1989 the ALEPH detector at the LEP $\Pep\Pem$ collider studied the $\PZz$ resonance and set strong constraints on the number of neutrino families $N_\PGn \simeq 3$ \cite{decampPreciseDeterminationNumber1990}, ruling out the possibility of a fourth (active) neutrino family and still suggesting a third --- up until then unobserved --- neutrino should exist. In 1975 the third ``\emph{heavier}'' brother of the electron and the muon, the tau, was discovered \cite{perlEvidenceAnomalousLepton1975}; this discovery led physicists to expect that a third neutrino had to exist. The tau neutrino signature was finally detected in 2000 in the DONuT (Direct Observation of the Nu Tau) experiment at Fermilab, twenty-five years after the discovery of the tau lepton. 

\section{Neutrinos in the Standard Model}

The state of the art of particle physics is defined by the Standard Model (SM). 
In the SM of particle physics the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions are described by the gauge symmetries $\mathrm{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y}$ \cite{peskinIntroductionQuantumField1995}.  The SM is the most comprehensive theory of particle physics, and has been experimentally tested with high accuracy. 
Neutrinos in the SM are massless fermions --- meaning that their spin is half-integer --- that do not have strong nor electromagnetic interactions. As all the particles in the SM, we can define the helicity $\mathcal H = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \vb p / \qty|\vb p|$ as the projection of the spin $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ on the particle momentum $\vb p$; however, differently to other particle content of the SM, for neutrinos only left-handed ($\mathcal H = -1$) neutrinos and right-handed ($\mathcal H = +1$) neutrinos have been observed. 
The experimental evidence of this peculiarity of neutrinos was discovered by M. Goldhaber, L. Grodzins and A. W. Sunyar in 1958 \cite{goldhaberHelicityNeutrinos1958}.
Helicity for massless particles is equivalent to their chirality (or handedness), which is why we can define positive helicity as right-handed and negative helicity as left-handed. 

The standard model for particle physics account for three families of neutrinos, each paired with the corresponding charged lepton: the electron neutrino $\PGne$, the muon neutrino $\PGnGm$ and the tau neutrino $\PGnGt$. 

\subsection{Neutrino interactions}

In the SM neutrino can, therefore, only interact via the weak interaction, which is mediated by three vector bosons (vector since they have integer spin), $\PWpm$ and $\PZz$. The experimental evidence of the $\PWpm$ and $\PZz$ bosons, constituting a strong proof of the SM theory, arrived between 1982 and 1983. The experiments UA1/UA2, led by Nobel physics laureate Carlo Rubbia, placed inside the CERN-S$\Pp\PAp$S accelerator ring, saw signatures of these bosons with proton-antiproton collisions with a high significance \cite{arnisonExperimentalObservationLepton1983, bannerObservationSingleIsolated1983a}. 

% some details of the type of interactions in the SM
The type of interactions that are possible for neutrinos are multiple. Giving a general enough picture of such interaction, usually a neutrino can create a vertex with either a $\PW$ boson --- thus resulting in a charged current (CC) event, with the corresponding charged lepton on the other side of such vertices --- or with a $\PZ$ boson --- resulting in a neutral current (NC) interaction, where the outgoing particle is the same flavour neutrino. In both cases, the diagram is completed by stitching on the other side of the boson line the interaction with the matter. The interaction in its entirety is required to conserve both charge and momentum. 
According to what the final state particles of the interaction are, the interactions themselves can be classified.

\paragraph{Charged current interactions} Neutrino-matter interactions show a rich phenomenology that varies dramatically across different energy scales. Multiple mechanisms determine the total cross-section of the $\PGn$-matter interaction, as shown by \autoref{fig:xs_both}. \begin{itemize}
    \item Starting on the lower part of the energy spectrum, the first mechanism is the quasielastic interaction. These have an energy peak around $E_\PGn\simeq \mathcal O (\SI{1}{GeV})$. In a QE event, the neutrino scatters off an entire nucleon rather than its constituent partons, converting the neutron to a proton and emitting a charged lepton \begin{equation}
        \PGn_\ell + \Pn \to \ell^- + \Pp, \quad \PAGn_\ell + \Pp \to \ell^+ + \Pn.
    \end{equation} The diagrams corresponding to such processes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:interaction_CCQE}. The QE neutrino cross-section can be accurately described by the V-A interaction theory, which is an intermediate description between the Fermi four-point interaction and the SM \cite{formaggioEVEeVNeutrino2012}.

    \item As we approach $E_\PGn \simeq \mathcal O (\SI{10}{GeV})$, the neutrino can excite the struck nucleon to an excited state. In this case, the neutrino interaction produces a baryon resonance, which quickly decays to a nucleon and single pion final state, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:interaction_CCRes} \begin{equation}
        \PGn_\ell + p \overset{\PGDpp}{\looongrightarrow} \ell^- + \PGpp + \Pp
    \end{equation} In such resonance productions, the neutrino interaction can be coherent, meaning the neutrino coherently scatters from the entire nucleus. These are referred to as coherent single pion final states, and such interactions have a small transferred momentum to the nucleon, producing no nuclear recoil and a distinctly forward-scattered pion. 

    \item When the neutrino energy exceeds \SI{10}{GeV}, the interaction is entirely at the parton level, breaking the nucleons and producing a final state interaction with high multiplicity,\begin{equation}
        \PGn_\ell + N^{(0)} \to \ell^- + X^{(+)}, \quad \PAGn_\ell + N^{(0)} \to \ell^+ + X^{(-)}
    \end{equation} where $X^{(\pm)}$ indicates the ensemble of the final state particles, with this notation highlighting that charge is still conserved, so an overall positive charge is expected. This interaction is called Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). This is exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:interaction_CCDIS}. 
\end{itemize}

%% NC interaction (and Gargamelle!)
\paragraph{Neutral current interactions} Up to this point, I presented only the charged current interactions topologies for neutrinos. Of course, as previously anticipated, the possible interactions include neutral current topologies that present the exchange of a $\PZz$ boson. Looking at the classification for CC events, we also have a similar classification for NC topologies. \begin{itemize}
    \item The lower part of the energy spectrum is populated by elastic scattering of neutrinos on nucleons, with each particle involved in the process not changing its nature, \[
        \brabar{\PGn_\ell} + N \to \ell^\pm + N, \quad \text{with $N = \Pp, \Pn$}.
    \] One of these processes is presented in Figure \ref{fig:interaction_NCEl}.

    \item NC Res. and NC Coh. single pion scattering processes are also possible, with a plethora of events possible; in Figure \ref{fig:interaction_NCRes} there is the single pion process mediated by the $\PGDp$ baryon \[
        \PGnGm + \Pp \overset{\PGDp}{\looongrightarrow} \PGnGm + \PGpp + \Pn.
    \]

    \item Finally, at high energy, the NC DIS processes are possible. Figure \ref{fig:interaction_NCDIS} shows an illustration of a DIS process, $\PGnGm + N^{(0)} \to \PGnGm + Y^{(0)}$. 
\end{itemize}

The Gargamelle experiment \cite{mussetNeutrinoPhysicsGargamelle1978} was a central experiment in the history of neutrino physics, being the first to actively detect signatures of neutral weak current events, thus confirming the validity of the weak interaction model \cite{hasertObservationNeutrinolikeInteractions1973, hasertSearchElasticMuonneutrino1973}. 
Full reviews of the neutrino interactions in matter (expanding more on the processes displayed in \autoref{fig:interactions}) are found in Ref. \cite{atharNeutrinosTheirInteractions2022, formaggioEVEeVNeutrino2012}

\subsection{Flavour oscillations}

Neutrinos are one of the most abundant ``visible'' particles in the universe. They are produced in multiple channels, many \emph{natural}, some \emph{artificial}. The production mechanism is correlated with the energy of the neutrinos. \begin{itemize}
    \item Neutrinos in the MeV scale are generated in reactions inside the stars cores (such as the Sun) through the $\Pp\Pp$-chain and the CNO cycle reactions;
    \item On the artificial side, neutrinos in the MeV region are those coming from nuclear fission reactors: electron antineutrinos originate as the $\beta$-decay products from unstable decaying fissioning isotopes such as $^{238}$U and $^{239}$Pu. The energies peak at \SI{3}{MeV} and extend up to \SI{8}{MeV}; 
    \item The core part of the energy spectrum, from some GeV to some \si{TeV}, is composed of atmospheric neutrinos, coming from cosmic rays interacting within the atmosphere. Those also compose the highest part of the spectrum;
    \item In the core region, there are also accelerator-borne beams of neutrinos. Those extend from some hundreds of MeV to some tens of GeV. These constitute an interesting part of the spectrum since their power can be controlled, hence their flux, making it easier to study in greater detail the properties of neutrinos.
\end{itemize}
Up to this point, the description of neutrinos has been of massless neutral leptons. However, experimental observations suggested otherwise. 

Dating back to the discovery of neutral mesons, the idea of flavour oscillation was established for massive particles. This was the case for the $\PKz/\PAKz$ oscillation discovery, which was studied to get an explanation for the regeneration of short-lived neutral kaons, $\PKzS$ \cite{landeReportLongLived$K^0$1957}. This type of oscillatory behaviour is well explained by the weak interaction of quarks in the SM Lagrangian with the Higgs mechanism that gives masses to quarks themselves, hence to mesons. Therefore, oscillatory behaviour is explained by the particle having mass. 

For neutrinos, such a hypothesis did not hold true,  and so no flavour oscillation was expected. However, theoretical models of neutrino oscillation date back to the '60s. In 1957 Pontecorvo discussed $\PGmp\Pem \leftrightarrow \PGmm\Pep$ \cite{pontecorvoMesoniumAntimesonium1957}, and the two-flavour neutrino oscillation physics was worked out by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata in 1962 \cite{makiRemarksUnifiedModel1962}. In this model, the oscillation probability was found to be proportional to \begin{equation}
    P(\PGn_\alpha \to \PGn_\beta) = \sin[2](2\theta_{\alpha\beta}) \sin[2](\frac{\Delta m^2 E_\PGn}{4L}),
\end{equation} where the probability of going fro the flavour state $\alpha$ to the flavour state $\beta$ is dependent on its amplitude $\sin[2](2\theta)$, the neutrino energy $E_\PGn$, the neutrino flight length, $L$ and the squared difference of the masses of the two neutrino flavours $\Delta m^2 = m_\alpha^2 - m_\beta^2$.

%. Osc. history (how we arrived here)
The first experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations came from the Homestake Mine solar neutrino experiment. Between the 1960s and 1980s this experiment, led by physicist R. Davis, used radiochemical technique to measure the flux of solar neutrinos. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{thesis/6_figures/theory/figure3}
    \caption[The solar neutrino flux produced by all the reactions inside Sun's core]{Solar neutrino flux produced by all the reactions inside the Sun's core. Taken from \cite{serenelliAliveWellShort2016}.}
    \label{fig:sun_flux}
\end{figure}

Neutrinos from the Sun come from multiple reactions inside the Sun's core. An energy spectrum of the neutrino flux is presented in \autoref{fig:sun_flux}. The detector used the capture process $\PGne + ^{37}\mathrm{Cl} \to ^{37}\mathrm{Ar} + \Pem$, with a threshold of \SI{814}{keV}, making only $^7$Be and $^8$B flux detectable by the experiment. The produced $^{37}$Ar decayed in $\sim\SI{34.8}{days}$ and was counted by means of a proportional chamber. Despite the huge number of neutrinos from solar flux $\sim\SI{6e10}{cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, only 1.7 events were expected each day \cite{bahcallStandardSolarModels1982,bahcallNewSolarOpacities2005}; however, the total flux collected by the Homestake Mine experiment amounted to an observed flux of \num{0.48(4)} neutrino interactions per day \cite{clevelandMeasurementSolarElectron1998}. This anomalous measurement is referred to the ``solar neutrino problem''. To investigate the origin of the ``solar neutrino problem'' other components of the $\Pp\Pp$ and CNO processes in the Sun's core,  other experiments were developed, with the aim of investigating the lower part of the energy spectrum. In particular, neutrinos from the $\Pp\Pp$ chain are the most abundant, so they were targeted to clarify this problem. In order to measure these neutrinos, the threshold had to be lowered. Using gallium, or gallium-doped targets, the neutrino capture process $\PGne + ^{71}\mathrm{Ga} \to ^{71}\mathrm{Ge} + \Pem$, with a threshold energy of \SI{233}{keV} it is possible to detect neutrinos from the $\Pp\Pp$ chain. Three experiments followed this idea: the SAGE experiment at Baksan \cite{collaborationMeasurementSolarNeutrino1999}, using \SI{50}{t} of liquid metallic gallium, and the GALLEX \cite{hampelGALLEXSolarNeutrino1999} experiment at \emph{Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso} (LNGS), using gallium chloride, $\mathrm{GaCl_3}$. The GALLEX experiment was followed by the GNO experiments, and their data was used for a combined analysis \cite{hampelGALLEXSolarNeutrino1999,altmannGNOSolarNeutrino2000}. These results highlighted that also for this lower region of the energy flux, the model was inconsistent with the data.  The same was shown by the results from the SAGE collaboration \cite{collaborationMeasurementSolarNeutrino1999}.

The landscape evolved in 1998 with the observation of atmospheric neutrinos by the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande detectors. Where the radiochemical detectors measure the reaction rate integrated between extractions, the real-time measurement of solar neutrinos was possible with this experiment. The Kamiokande detector was a \SI{3000}{t} water-Cherenkov detector in the Kamioka mine. Super-Kamiokande (SK, for short), the successor of Kamiokande, started operation in 1996. It is a large upright cylindrical water Cherenkov detector containing \SI{50}{kt} of pure water. An inner volume of \SI{32}{kt} of water was surrounded by \num{11000} photomultiplier tubes (PMT), detecting the Cherenkov radiation from the particles inside the volume. Both Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande can detect solar neutrinos using neutrino-electron elastic scattering (ES), $\PGn_\ell\Pem \to \PGn_\ell\Pem$. The results of Kamiokande and SK for $\PGne$ES events still showed a decrease of the observed flux $(\mathrm{2.308\pm0.020(stat.)^{+0.039}_{-0.040}(syst.)})\times \num{e6}$ \si{cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}} \cite{super-kamiokandecollaborationSolarNeutrinoMeasurements2016}, with respect to the expected flux of \SI{5.46+-0.66}{cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}. %This constitutes the ``atmospheric neutrino problem''. 

% atmospheric neutrino anomaly...
The Kamioka water Cherenkov detector, as well as the Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) water Cherenkov detector, were also able to detect, other than electrons and electron neutrinos coming from the Sun's core, muons, and muon neutrinos. Those are predicted to be originating in Earth's atmosphere. Those experiments observed a deficit \cite{hirataExperimentalStudyAtmospheric1988, casperMeasurementAtmosphericNeutrino1991} of neutrinos from what was expected. This constitutes the ``atmospheric neutrino problem''. Atmospheric neutrinos come from interactions between cosmic rays and nuclei in the atmosphere, leading to the production of charged mesons, which then decay. One of the leading channels of this chain is the pion decay, $\PGppm\to\PGmpm+\brabar{\PGnGm}$, and the subsequent muon decay, $\PGmpm \to \Pepm + \brabar{\PGnGm} + \brabar{\PGne}$, implying  a flavour ratio $(\PGne + \PAGne) / (\PGnGm + \PAGnGm) = 1/2$. 

The solution for this ``atmospheric neutrino problem'' came directly with the SK detector, by following the hypothesis that neutrinos do oscillate, and hence that a deficit of muon neutrinos had to be found as an increase in the population of electron and tau neutrinos. The data collected by SK showed a good agreement for atmospheric neutrinos assuming a two-flavour oscillation \cite{ashieEvidenceOscillatorySignature2004}, with $\sin[2](2\theta) > 0.90$ and $\SI{1.9e-3}{eV^2} < \Delta m^2 < \SI{3e-3}{eV^2}$ at \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level. The confirmation for this will come from subsequent experimental efforts, especially from the OPERA detector working at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), detecting neutrinos from the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) beam --- it did, in fact, detect tau neutrinos \cite{collaborationDiscoveryTauNeutrino2015} from the CNGS $\PGnGm$-disappearance. 

The solution for the ``solar neutrino problem'' came in the early 2000s, with the experimental results by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO, for short) \cite{collaborationMeasurementRateNu_e2001}. This experiment used \SI{1000}{t} of heavy water, $\mathrm{D_2O}$, contained in a spherical vessel surrounded by a $\mathrm{H_2O}$ shield. An array of PMTs looked at the Cherenkov radiation produced in both $\mathrm{D_2O}$ and $\mathrm{H_2O}$. This way the detector was able to look for multiple signatures of $^8$B from the Sun's core: in addition to ES scattering in water, heavy water allowed for the detection of CC $\PGne + \HepParticle{d}{}{} \to \Pem + \Pp+\Pp$, and NC $\PGn_\ell + \HepParticle{d}{}{} \to \PGn_\ell + \Pn+\Pp$, where $\ell = \Pe, \PGm, \PGt$ are all the SM neutrino flavours. Therefore, by comparing the three fluxes (ES, CC and NC), each sensible to one or more neutrino flavours, this detector was able to measure the full neutrino solar flux. The results of the SNO collaboration of CC and NC interactions, combined with the ES events collected by SK, published between 2001 and 2002, allowed the computation of the full flux of neutrinos from the Sun, highlighting that flavour conversion happened also in neutrinos \cite{collaborationDirectEvidenceNeutrino2002, collaborationMeasurementRateNu_e2001, collaborationSolar8BHep2001}. The final test came with the knowledge of neutrino oscillation in matter, through the MSW effect. The mass splitting reported by the SAGE \cite{abdurashitovMeasurementSolarNeutrino2009} and GALLEX+GNO \cite{altmannCompleteResultsFive2005} experiments was in the order of $\Delta m^2 \sim \SI{e-5}{eV^2}$, with the oscillation amplitude $\sin[2](2\theta)\sim0.3$.

%. Theory, to formalize all
\subsubsection{Flavour oscillation formalism}

In the standard model of particle physics, the flavour oscillation is closely related with the mass mechanism, i.e. how elementary particle get teir masses. This is the case for the hadronic sector, where the mass mechanism is linked with flavour oscillation via the $V_\mathrm{CKM}$ matrix \cite{peskinIntroductionQuantumField1995}.

In the case of neutrinos, there is not \emph{one} mechanism for their masses --- there are upper limits to their mass value \cite{navasReviewParticlePhysics2024}, but since no direct measurement has been made to date, no hypothesis is stronger than others. Any model that aims at providing a valid mechanism for neutrino masses, however, is successful in describing the oscillatory behaviour.  The key for describing why neutrinos oscillate lies in what is that we actually call ``neutrinos.'' We \emph{cannot} see neutrinos directly as we can, for example, in the case of muons or electrons: we have to look at the products of neutrino interactions to be able to say whether it was an electron neutrino, a muon neutrino or a tau neutrino. We usually call $\PGne, \PGnGm, \PGnGt$ neutrinos, but in order to be more formal, we should say that this is the flavour eigenstate basis. As for the quarks, the mass basis can be different from the flavour basis. We define the mass basis as $\PGn_1, \PGn_2, \PGn_3$. What I have just said, about neutrinos being only detectable through their interaction products, can be more formally expressed as follows. The flavour eigenstate basis of neutrinos is that which undergoes weak interaction; on the other hand, the mass eigenstate basis is that which undergoes time transformation, and the masses are their eigenvalues, dictating how an eigenstate evolves through time. We can express each base as a rotation of the other, using the complex-valuex Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, 
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\PGn_\alpha} = \sum_{i=1}^3 U_{\mathrm{PMNS},\ \alpha i}^* \ket{\PGn_i},\quad \ket{\PGn_i} = \sum_{\alpha=1}^3 U_{\mathrm{PMNS},\ \alpha i} \ket{\PGn_\alpha}, \label{eq:basis_rotation}
\end{equation} where the Greek indices indicate the flavour eigenstate basis, and the Roman ones indicate the mass eigenstate basis.

The complex-valued $U_\mathrm{PMNS}$ matrix can be expressed as the product of three rotations and a complex phase \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        U_\mathrm{PMNS} &= \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & \cos\theta_{23} & \sin\theta_{23} \\
            0 & -\sin\theta_{23} & \cos\theta_{23} \\
        \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}
            \cos\theta_{13} & 0 & \sin\theta_{13}\ e^{-i\delta} \\
            0 & 1 & 0\\
            -\sin\theta_{23}\ e^{i\delta} & 0 & \cos\theta_{23} \\
        \end{pmatrix} \times\\ 
        &\hspace{7cm}\times \begin{pmatrix}
            \cos\theta_{12} & \sin\theta_{12} & 0\\
            -\sin\theta_{12} & \cos\theta_{12} & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 1\\
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{aligned} \label{eq:PMNS}
\end{equation} where $\theta_{ij}$ are the rotation angles, and $\delta$ is the Charge-Partiy (CP) violating phase, often referred to as $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$. The theory, in the case neutrinos were Majorana particles\footnote{This is a delicate question; here I am making the hypothesis that three right-handed Majorana neutrinos exists. A model where more than $n=3$ Majorana neutrinos exists would require more parameters, thus the PMNS matrix would be different.}, would require two additional phases, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$. This is obtained by multiplying the PMNS matrix by \[\mathrm{diag}\qty(e^{i\alpha_1/2}, e^{i\alpha_2/2}, 1).\]

Given the rotations in \eqref{eq:basis_rotation}, neutrino oscillation arise from the time evolution of the massive eigenstates $\PGn_i$, in vacuum \cite{zuberNeutrinoPhysics2020} \begin{equation}
    \ket{\PGn_i, t} = e^{-i p \cdot x} \ket{\PGn_i, t_0 = 0} = e^{-i E\ t  + \vb p \cdot \vb x} \ket{\PGn_i, t_0 = 0}.\label{eq:time_evolution}
\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{eq:basis_rotation} and \eqref{eq:time_evolution} leads to the flavour basis to oscillate as the mass eigenstates evolve in time (hereafter, $\ket{\PGn_i} = \ket{\PGn_i, t = 0}$ and the same for the Greek indices), \begin{equation}
    \ket{\PGn_\alpha, t} = \sum_{i} U_{\alpha i}^* e^{-i E\ t  + \vb p \cdot \vb x} \ket{\PGn_i} = \sum_\beta \qty(\sum_{i} U_{\alpha i}^* e^{-i E\ t  + \vb p \cdot \vb x} U_{\beta i}) \ket{\PGn_\beta}. 
\end{equation} The probability of evolving from the initial state $\beta$ to the final state $\alpha$ at a given time $t$ is given by \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(\PGn_\alpha \to \PGn_\beta) &= \qty|\braket{\PGn_\beta}{\PGn_\alpha, t}|^2 = \qty|\sum_i\sum_j U^*_{\alpha i}U_{\beta j} \braket{\PGn_j}{\PGn_i, t}|^2 = \\
        & = \delta_{\alpha\beta} - 4\sum_{i<j} \Re[U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\alpha j}^* U_{\beta j}] \sin[2](1.26 \ \frac{\Delta m^2_{ij} }{\si{eV^2}}\ \frac{L/E}{\si{m/MeV}}) + \\
        &\qquad\qquad + 2 \sum_{i<j} \Im[U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\alpha j}^* U_{\beta j}] \sin(2\times1.26 \ \frac{\Delta m^2_{ij} }{\si{eV^2}}\ \frac{L/E}{\si{m/MeV}}). \label{eq:oscillation_nbody}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation} We have made the assumptions that, for $m_i \ll p_i$, since $E = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2}$, $\qty|\vb p|$ tends to $E$, and also \[
    E = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2} \simeq p + \frac{m^2}{2p} \simeq p + \frac{m^2}{2E}.
\] It is important to highlight --- especially for reasons I will present later on (see \autoref{sec:anomalies}) --- that no hypothesis about the number of neutrinos has been made to obtain such oscillation probability. Thus, equation \eqref{eq:oscillation_nbody} is valid for any number $N$ of neutrinos family, as long as the mixing PMNS matrix is $N\times N$. 

Looking closely at the contributions of \eqref{eq:oscillation_nbody}, we highlight three components. The first $\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is equivalent to not having any oscillation --- becomes important in disappearance studies. The second term, proportional to $\Re[U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\alpha j}^* U_{\beta j}]$ is closely related to the mixing angles, but is not sensible in any way to the $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ CP violating complex phase. This is instead related --- thereby measured by looking at --- the $\Im[U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\alpha j}^* U_{\beta j}]$ term of the equation. 

Finally, some remarks are necessary about the equation in \eqref{eq:oscillation_nbody}. The first remark is regarding the Majorana phases, intrduced briefly after \eqref{eq:PMNS}. As it is clear if we further develop the related math of eq. \eqref{eq:oscillation_nbody}, the $N$-flavour oscillation is not sensitive to the Majorana phases, for which a different type of research is required: this is still strictly related to the problem of neutrino masses and also to the CP violation problem \cite{brancoMajoranaNeutrinosCP1986, navasReviewParticlePhysics2024}, but not dealt with in this thesis.

A second remark is that, as already pointed out when discussing the solution of the ``solar neutrino problem'' before, the computation presented in  \eqref{eq:oscillation_nbody} is valid only for neutrinos propagating through vacuum space. In the case of propagation through matter, it is important to consider the effect such interaction might produce and its impact on neutrino oscillation. This effect was first computed by Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, hence the name MSW effect. This effect shows, starting from the hypothesis that neutrinos in matter interact coherently, how the difference between the electron neutrino flavour --- which can interact both through CC and NC coherent scatter with the nuclei ---, and the muon/tau neutrino flavours --- interacting only through NC coherent scattering --- result in a difference of their oscillation probability \cite{mikheevResonantAmplificationNeutrino1986, mikheyevResonanceAmplificationOscillations1985, wolfensteinNeutrinoOscillationsMatter1978}. This effect, while not essential for short baseline experiments such as the SBN program, is core for long baseline experiments, like the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment \cite{kellyMatterDensityProfile2018}, and for solar neutrino experiments, which have to take into account the oscillation probability induced by neutrinos crossing the Sun's radius. 

The final remark is about the experimental values of the mass splitting. As I will show later on, with the current status of neutrino oscillation experiments, we have identified two values of mass splitting: one coming from the best fit of atmospheric neutrino oscillations ($\PGnGm\leftrightarrow\PGnGt$ oscillations), which I will call $\qty|\Delta m^2_\mathrm{Atmospheric}|$, and the other from the best fit of solar neutrino oscillations (mainly $\PGne\leftrightarrow\PGnGm$ oscillations), which I will call $\Delta m^2_\mathrm{Solar}$. The peculiarity is that these values show two orders of magnitude of difference, \begin{equation}
    \qty|\Delta m^2_\mathrm{Atmospheric}| \simeq \SI{e-3}{eV^2} \gg \Delta m^2_\mathrm{Solar} \simeq \SI{e-5}{eV^2}.
\end{equation} Since we cannot know, for the atmospheric oscillations, the sign of the mass splitting, there are two possible pictures. The first, called normal ordering or normal hierarchy (NO/NH), assumes a positive sign for both, and so $m_1^2 \leq m_2^2 \leq m_3^2$. The other option assumes a negative sign for the atmospheric mass splitting, and thus $m_3^2 \leq m_1^2 \leq m_2^2$. \autoref{fig:ordering} shows an illustration of both NO (left) and IO (right). The mass splitting difference also allows, in most cases, to distinctly separate the two oscillation frequencies. This is why, for most short- and long-baseline experiments, it is usually more convenient to approximate the oscillation as a two-flavour oscillation.

\subsubsection{Present status}

To quantify neutrino oscillations is to measure the parameters of the PMNS matrix. As we can read from \eqref{eq:PMNS}, it depends on three angles and a complex phase, so in order to measure it correctly, multiple experimental measurements must be carried out. Additionally, one aims at knowing the precise value of the mass splittings. Each parameter can be accessed by exploiting different neutrino sources in order to vary the baseline and the energy or the $L/E$ ratio of the measured interaction to pinpoint each parameter in the phase space. Additionally, oscillation measurements are classified either as ``appearance'' experiments, where the oscillation from one flavour $\alpha$ to another flvour $\beta$ is measured, or as ``disappearance'' measurements, where the probability $P(\PGn_\alpha \to \PGn_\alpha) = 1 - \sum_{\beta\neq\alpha} P(\PGn_\alpha \to \PGn_\beta)$ of getting the same flavour at different distances from the sources is tested. 

The distance of the detector from the experimental source is usually selected to maximise the sensitivity to a precise mass splitting, $\Delta m^2 \sim E/L$. 

Recently, the precision with which these parameters are determined reached a percent value, allowing neutrino oscillation physics to move from ``discovery'' field to the ``precision'' era. 

\paragraph{Solar neutrino observations} Solar neutrinos have been the first probe for neutrino oscillations and still are an interesting source to both study neutrino oscillations and also to test neutrino interaction in matter. The $E/L$ of neutrinos from the sun, given that $\SI{233}{keV} \leq E_\PGn \lesssim \si{MeV}$, limits the values of mass splitting to those of the solar mass splitting, $\Delta m^2_\mathrm{Solar} \sim \SI{e-5}{eV^2}$. This limits oscillation to mainly a two-flavour oscillation $\PGne\leftrightarrow\PGnGm$, so that mainly $\sin\theta_{12}$ is accessible. The complete picture is obtained from multiple years of observations from multiple detectors, leading to a best value of $\Delta m_{21}^2 \simeq \qtyrange{6.92e-5}{8.05e-5}{eV^2}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12} \simeq \numrange{0.275}{0.345}$ at $3\sigma$. These results come from combining the results from the Soviet-American Gallium Experiment (SAGE) \cite{abdurashitovMeasurementSolarNeutrino2009}, the gallium experiment (GALLEX), combined with the Gallium Neutrino Observatory (GNO) \cite{altmannCompleteResultsFive2005}, the Kamiokande and SK experiments \cite{collaborationSolarNeutrinoMeasurements2024}, joined by the BOREXINO experiment \cite{agostiniExperimentalEvidenceNeutrinos2020} and the KamLAND experiment \cite{kamlandcollaboration$^7mathrmBe$SolarNeutrino2015}. 

\paragraph{Atmospheric neutrinos} The $L/E$ ratio for neutrinos generated by pion decay in the atmosphere allows exploring the $\PGnGm\leftrightarrow\PGnGt$ oscillation phase space that is characterised by a mass splitting $|\Delta m_{32}^2| = |\Delta m_\mathrm{Atmospheric}^2| \sim \SI{e-3}{eV^2}$, and so allows for the determination of $\sin\theta_{23}$. Atmospheric neutrino oscillations have been studied by the Kamiokande experiment \cite{hirataExperimentalStudyAtmospheric1988} and its successor, Super-Kamiokande \cite{ashieEvidenceOscillatorySignature2004}, by the MACRO experiment \cite{collaborationMatterEffectsUpwardGoing2001}, and also by neutrino telescopes, such as the ANTARES experiment and the IceCube experiment. Novel experiments will join this research, such as the KM3NeT-ORCA telescope, the successor of the ANTARES experiment, the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, the JUNO experiment, and the DUNE experiment. 

\paragraph{Accelerator neutrinos} A similar phase space to that of atmospheric neutrino oscillations can be explored by the accelerator neutrino experiments, especially at long baselines. Accelerator neutrinos can be interesting still, since they provide a large flux with a great purity of the beam. Conventional neutrino beams from accelerators are produced by colliding high-energy particles onto a target --- usually $\Pp$ on a $^7$Be target --- producing $\PGp$ and $\PK$, which then decay into neutrinos. The branching ratio of $\PGpp \to \PGmp\PGnGm$ is $\sim\SI{100}{\percent}$, with minimal contamination from $\PGne$ and $\PAGne$, coming from kaon decays. The values of neutrino energy and baselines are chosen to maximise the oscillation probability, either for studying the atmospheric mass splitting $\qty|\Delta m_{21}^2| \simeq \SI{2.5e-3}{eV^2}$, with the first oscillation maximum at $L/E \simeq \SI{500}{GeV/km}$, or for testing the $\Delta m^2 \sim \SI{1}{eV^2}$ splitting at $\sim \SI{1}{km}$ baselines. 

The present landscape of the accelerator neutrino experiments is vast, from the first experiments being the K2K and MINOS experiments --- exploring the values of $\Delta m_{31}^2$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$, studying the $\PGnGm$-disappearance channel --- to their successor, the T2K experiment, successor of the K2K experiment, employing Super-Kamiokande as its far detector at \SI{295}{km}, and the NOvA experiment, collecting neutrinos from the Neutrino at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at a baseline of \SI{810}{km}. Both T2K and NOvA measured $\Delta m_{31}^2$, $\Delta m_{32}^2$ , and $\sin\theta_{23}$ by measuring oth the $\PGne$-appearance and $\PGnGm$-disappearance channels from a pure $\PGnGm$ beam \cite{abeObservationElectronNeutrino2014, collaborationMeasurementsNeutrinoOscillation2023, collaborationConstraintsOscillationParameters2017}. Additionally, both experiments were capable of measuring the $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ violating phase of the PMNS matrix. The T2K collaboration showed a preference towards $\delta_\mathrm{CP}\sim\pi/2$ \cite{collaborationMeasurementsNeutrinoOscillation2023}, whereas the NOvA collaboration showed a preference towards $\delta_\mathrm{CP}\sim3\pi/2$ \cite{collaborationConstraintsOscillationParameters2017}. 

\paragraph{Reactor antineutrinos} Nuclear fission reactors give a substantial flux of electron antineutrinos in the \si{MeV} region, through $\beta$-decay of radioactive isotopes created during the fission process, primarily $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu; $\PAGne$ are then detected at different baselines$\sim\SI{1}{km}$. Charged current events cannot happen, given the neutrino energies, for $\PAGnGt$ or $\PAGnGt$ since they require more energy to produce $\PGm$ or $\PGt$ in the final state than what is accessible, so flavour oscillation for such experiments is only accessible through the $\PAGne$-disappearance channel. The detection mechanism is from the inverse beta decay $\Pp + \PAGne \to \Pep + \Pn$, where the signal from the prompt $\Pep$ and the $\PGg$ (with the energy depending on the type of scintillator; \SI{2.2}{MeV} for hydrogen, \SI{8}{MeV} when it is loaded with gallium) from the thermalisation of the neutron helps separate it from the background. 

The Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND) experiment was one of the first milestones in neutrino physics, detecting neutrinos from multiple nuclear reactors at $\sim \SI{180}{km}$ from the detector, and detected a ratio of observed inverse $\beta$ decay over the predicted flux of $\mathrm{0.611 \pm 0.085(stat) \pm 0.041(syst)}$ \cite{collaborationFirstResultsKamLAND2003}, showing evidence for $\PAGne$-disappearance at \SI{99.95}{\percent} confidence level. 

Reactor antineutrino experiments also showed very high sensitivity to the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. This is possible by looking at a short baseline $\sim \SI{1}{km}$: such searches have been performed by the Double Chooz experiment \cite{abeIndicationDisappearanceReactor2012}, the Daya Bay experiment \cite{anObservationElectronantineutrinoDisappearance2012}, and the RENO experiment \cite{kimObservationReactorElectron2012}, which found, respectively, \begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        \sin^22\theta_{13} &= \mathrm{0.086 \pm 0.041 (stat) \pm 0.030 (syst)},\\
        & \text{or}\ 0.017 < \sin^22\theta_{13} < 0.16\ \text{at \SI{90}{\percent} CL}
    \end{aligned} && \text{(Double Chooz)}\\
    &\sin^22\theta_{13} = \mathrm{0.092 \pm 0.016(stat) \pm 0.005(syst)} && \text{(Daya Bay)}\\
    &\sin^22\theta_{13} = \mathrm{0.113 \pm 0.013(stat) \pm 0.019(syst)} && \text{(RENO)}
\end{align} 

\section{Short baseline anomalies}\label{sec:anomalies}

It is clear at this point that the picture of neutrino flavour oscillation is well established, from the empirical point of view, leading to the clear necessity of a ``minimal'' extension of the standard model in order to introduce neutrino masses. Since the nature of neutrinos is very different from other particles of the standard model, generating their masses would require a novel mechanism. Multiple beyond SM physics (BSM) models have been developed, many of which would require the addition of particle content to the SM; however strong the evidence for neutrino masses is, no direct measurement has been made to date, and no model is preferred over the others. 

In addition to this dilemma, in the past twenty years the picture has been complicated by some anomalous observations that could be hinting at the possibility of a fourth neutrino state. This was suggested by a series of ``short-baseline'' experiments --- for which $L/E \sim \SI{10}{m}/\si{MeV}$ \cite{aceroWhitePaperLight2024}. 

The Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) at Los Alamos Laboratories detected $\PAGne$ from oscillated $\PAGnGm$ using a liquid scintillator and observed an excess of electron antineutrinos, with a tension of $3.8\sigma$ from the model \cite{aguilarEvidenceNeutrinoOscillations2001}. This result was tested by the MiniBooNE experiment with different neutrino sources and at a different baseline, which claimed a similar result with a significance of $4.8\sigma$ \cite{collaborationCombined$n_mtoN_e$2012}. Reactor antineutrino measurements, which played a significant role in establishing the three-flavour oscillation paradigm for neutrinos, also observed a decrease in flux of electron antineutrinos at baseline distances $<\SI{100}{m}$, with a ratio to the prediction $R=\num{0.976+-0.024}$ \cite{mentionReactorAntineutrinoAnomaly2011} --- this is the ``reactor antineutrino anomaly''. Of equal importance in the discovery of flavour oscillation are the solar neutrino experiments. GALLEX and SAGE \cite{collaborationMeasurementSolarNeutrino1999, hampelGALLEXSolarNeutrino1999} employed radiochemical techniques to detect solar neutrinos with gallium; calibration was performed using megacurie radioactive sources and returned anomalous fluxes in the $\PGne$-disappearance channel, with an observed-expected ratio $R=\num{0.86\pm0.05}$, showing a $2.2\sigma$ statistical significance: this, corroborated by the results of the BEST experiment --- which increased this significance to $\sim4\sigma$ \cite{elliottGalliumAnomaly2023} --- constitutes the ``Gallium anomaly'' (or GA). The combination of these anomalies at short baselines of $\sim\SI{1}{km}$ hints at the existence of a fourth neutrino flavour with a mass splitting $\Delta m^2 \sim \SI{1}{eV}$. This, combined with the fact that only three ``active'' (i.e. interacting) families of neutrinos are compatible with the experimental results so far \cite{decampPreciseDeterminationNumber1990}, lead to the ``sterile'' neutrino hypothesis: a neutrino that does not undergo weak interaction and is subject to gravitational force.

\paragraph{Pion decay-at-rest accelerator experiments} Pion decay-at-rest provide with a very pure muon antineutrino flux with a mean energy of $E_\PAGn\simeq \SI{30}{MeV}$. As such, a detector placed at a relatively short baseline $\sim\SI{30}{m}$ is sensitive to oscillation with a mass splitting $\sim\SI{1}{eV^2}$. Two major experiments employed this technology to produce neutrino beams, the LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector) and the KARMEN (KArlsruhe Rutherford Medium Energy Neutrino) experiments. Of the two, LSND had the highest sensitivity and observed the ``LNSD anomaly''. The KARMEN experiment saw no evidence of such an anomaly, and it is thus considered a ``null'' experiment for the sterile neutrino framework \cite{collaborationUpperLimitsNeutrino2002}. 

The LSND experiment consisted of a cylindrical tank of \SI{8.3}{m} of height and a diameter of \SI{5.7}{m}, placed horizontally, filled with \SI{167}{metric\ ton} of mineral oil. LNSD detected electron antineutrinos from a beam of muon antineutrinos, produced by pions decaying at rest (DAR). The pions were produced by protons with $E_\Pp\simeq \SI{798}{MeV}$ hitting a target and stopped in water. The signal selection proceeded by looking at both the scintillation light and the Cherenkov light cone produced by the positron (see figure \ref{fig:LSND_detector} for a schematic illustration) correlated with a \SI{2.2}{MeV} photon signal produced by neutron capture. Scintillation and Cherenkov light were collected by means of 1220 PMTs. The LNSD detector collected data showing an excess of events of $\mathrm{87.9 \pm 22.4\ (stat) \pm 6.0\ (sys)}$, compatible with the hypothesis of a two-flavour oscillation $\PAGnGm\to\PAGne$. The fit pointed toward an oscillation amplitude of $\sin^22\theta_{\PGm\Pe} \simeq \num{0.003}$ and a mass splitting of $\Delta m^2 \simeq \SI{1.2}{eV^2}$, resulting in the allowed regions at \SI{90}{\percent} CL and \SI{99}{\percent} CL shown in figure \ref{fig:LSND_lhd} \cite{lsndcollaborationEvidenceNeutrinoOscillations2001}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Pion decay-in-flight accelerator experiments} LNSD's evidence for this oscillation prompted subsequent searches that needed to be independent. This is why pion decay-in-flight (DIF) was selected as a valid production mechanism: it produces a pure $\brabar{\PGnGm}$ beam with higher energy, providing the opportunity for an independent test at a higher baseline. This was accomplished using the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) with the MiniBooNE Cherenkov detector at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratories (Fermilab) in Illinois, providing a \SI{99.5}{\percent} pure muon neutrino beam with a mean energy of $\sim \SI{700}{MeV}$. The design of this experiment was made to allow the phase space to align with that of the LNSD experiment: $E/L \sim \SI{30}{MeV}/\SI{30}{m}$ for the LNSD experiment, so the same was accomplished by placing the MiniBooNE detector at \SI{540}{m}. The MiniBooNE detector consisted of a single tank containing \SI{818}{\tonne} of mineral oil. The detection was performed looking for Cherenkov radiation inside the tank with 1520 PMTs, and the Cherenkov signature was used to separate between $\PGne$CC and $\PGnGm$CC events; this selection suffered from backgrounds coming mainly from NC interactions inside the tank and NC $\PGpz$ interactions where one photon from the $\PGpz$ decay is not identified. The MiniBooNE experiment took data from 2002 to 2019, collecting a total of \SI{18.75e20}{POT} (protons-on-target) interactions with both a neutrino mode and an antineutrino mode, showing an excess of events in the signal region $\SI{200}{MeV} < E_\PGn^\mathrm{QE} < \SI{475}{MeV}$, with a statistical significance of $4.8\sigma$ \cite{collaborationUpdatedMiniBooNENeutrino2021}. This excess is known by the name of Low Energy Excess, LEE, shown in \autoref{fig:MiniBooNE}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Reactor antineutrino experiments} In the most simple sterile neutrino picture (more about this later in \autoref{sec:sterile_theory}) where one sterile neutrino is assumed, non-zero $\PGne$ disappearance oscillation in neutrinos from reactors should be possible, with detectors placed $<\SI{100}{m}$ from the neutrino source. In such experiments at ILL-Grenoble, Goesgen, Rovno, Krasnoyarsk, Savannah River and Bugey \cite{mentionReactorAntineutrinoAnomaly2011}, the measured rate of $\PGne$ was found to be in reasonable agreement with that predicted from the reactor antineutrino spectra, though slightly lower than expected, with the measured/expected ratio at $R=\num{0.976+-.024}$, representing a $2.7\sigma$ deviation from the prediction. This is known as the ``reactor antineutrino anomaly'' (RAA). The additional measurements by the long-baseline detectors KamLAND and CHOOZ provided a stricter lower result of such ratio, at $R=\num{0.943 +- 0.023}$, deviating from the unity with a statistical significance of $\SI{98.6}{\percent}$ CL. 

\paragraph{Radioactive sources experiments} Radioactive sources are often used as calibration for different types of detectors. This was the case for both the GALLEX and SAGE solar neutrinos detectors. Such experiments employ natural radioactive sources, either $^{51}$Cr or $^{37}$Ar, which both produce electron neutrinos through electron capture processes \begin{align}
    \Pem + {}^{51}\mathrm{Cr} &\to {}^{51}\mathrm{V} + \PGne, && \text{(GALLEX)}\\
    \Pem + {}^{37}\mathrm{Ar} &\to {}^{37}\mathrm{Cl} + \PGne, && \text{(GALLEX, SAGE)}
\end{align} placed inside the detector, to calibrate the flux of electron neutrinos with respect to the rate of electron capture processes $\PGne + {}^{71}\mathrm{Ga} \to {}^{71}\mathrm{Ge} + \Pem$ observed. Both experiments observed a deficit of counts during the detector calibration with respect to the well-known and computed activities of the sources and the cross-section for the measurements, with average ratio $\overline R$ ranging from $\numrange{0.703 +- 0.078}{0.844 +- 0.031}$ \cite{giuntiGalliumAnomalyCritical2022}. A dedicated experiment was planned, Baksan Experiment on Sterile Transitions (BEST), where a larger deficit was observed, confirming the Gallium anomaly. The combined ratio show a statistical significance of $4\sigma$, with $\overline{R} = \num{0.80+-0.04}$. 

\subsection{The sterile neutrino hypothesis} \label{sec:sterile_theory}

The picture presented so far seems to hint, from multiple perspective, to the possibility of a sterile neutrino scenario. This requires the introduction of a fourth sterile --- i.e. not weakly interacting --- neutrino state, taking part in short baseline oscillation, with a mass splitting of $\Delta m^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\SI{1}{eV^2})$. The need for this state to be ``sterile'' is required to minimally extend the SM, since the introduction of a massive weakly interacting particle with $m<m_\PZ/2$ would not be possible. 

I claimed before that the PMNS matrix size did not prevent neutrino oscillation from being possible in the current picture. Thus, the most general approach to introducing sterile particle content in the leptonic sector would be to add $N$ sterile neutrinos and consider a $(3+N)\times(3+N)$ PMNS matrix. This is correct and the most general way of introducing sterile neutrinos in the model, but to keep the number of parameters in the model as small as possible, it is effectively interesting to look at a ``simpler'' model, where only one additional sterile family is introduced. This $3+1$ paradigm, which is what I will consider moving forward, requires the introduction of a sterile state $\PGns$, and a basis of four massive neutrinos $\PGn_1, \dots, \PGn_4$, with the additional assumption that the fraction of $\PGns$ is extremely small for the first three mass eigenstates and near \SI{100}{\percent} for the fourth, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:ordering_NO_sterile}. 

\input{thesis/6_figures/theory/ordering_NO_sterile}

From the experimental evidence we can assign $\Delta m^2_{4\ell} \sim \mathcal O (\SI{1}{eV^2})$, and observing that it is greater of both the atmospheric and the solar mass splitting, the oscillation probability can be computed by assuming that both are near zero, giving rise to a two-flavour oscillation probability   \begin{align}
    P(\PGn_\ell \rightarrow \PGn_\ell) &\simeq 1 - 4 |U_{\ell4}|^2 (1 - |U_{\ell4}|^2) \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{41} L}{4 E_\PGn} \right) \nonumber \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad\equiv 1 - \sin^2 (2\theta_{\ell\ell}) \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{41} L}{4 E_\PGn} \right),\quad \ell = \Pe, \PGm\\
    P(\PGnGm \rightarrow \PGne) &\simeq 4 |U_{\PGm4}|^2 |U_{\Pe4}|^2 \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{41} L}{4 E_\PGn} \right) \nonumber \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad\equiv \sin^2 (2\theta_{\PGm\Pe}) \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{41} L}{4 E_\PGn} \right).
\end{align} where the first can be either the disappearance probability of electron or muon neutrinos, and the second controls the appearance probability of electron neutrinos from a beam of pure muon neutrinos. The ``effective'' mixing angles $\theta_{\alpha\beta}$ are directly correlated with the elements of the extended PMNS matrix in the hypothesis of a $3+1$ oscillation scenario. 

\subsection{Experimental status and future perspectives}

The current experimental landscape of the sterile neutrino anomalies has broadened, with even more experiments adding limits to the phase space. To this day no definitive picture has completely proved or discarded the existence of this fourth sterile neutrino state. 

The experimental landscape can be classified by the channel where it is performing its research and by the result it found (i.e. \emph{did it find any anomaly?}).

One of the strongest experimental anomalies comes from the LNSD experiment. The excess found by this experiment is compatible with the hypothesis of an oscillation picture, suggesting a mass splitting $\Delta m_{41}^2 \simeq \qtyrange{0.2}{10}{eV^2}$. The LNSD experiment was followed by the MiniBooNE experiment. The MiniBooNE LEE in $\PGne$-appearance analysis is compatible with the results of the LNSD experiment, still preferring a higher mixing angle $\sin^22\theta sim \num{0.807}$ and smaller mass splitting $\Delta m^2 \simeq \SI{0.043}{eV^2}$, compared to that of LNSD. It is interesting to see (for reference, see \autoref{fig:MiniBooNE}) that the $3+1$ sterile scenario did not fully explain the excess seen by the MiniBooNE experiment. 

Similar to the LSND experiment was the KARMEN experiment, which, however, did not find any signature of $\PAGnGm\to\PAGne$ oscillations \cite{collaborationUpperLimitsNeutrino2002}. The KARMEN experiment operated at similar conditions to those of the LSND experiment, but at a shorter baseline, restricting its allowed parameter space. This posed some limits to the allowed parameter space of the LSND experiment but could not fully cover it all, thus not excluding its claim. Other ``null'' experiments were performed following the results of LSND and MiniBooNE, including the NOMAD experiment, which operated at a baseline of about \SI{620}{m} from the source of neutrinos, produced using the SPS accelerator at CERN, with energies of $\sim\SI{20}{GeV}$. It excluded at \SI{90}{\percent} CL the higher mass splitting values, giving the constraints $\Delta m^2 < \SI{0.4}{eV^2}$ (with maximal mixing) and $\sin^22\theta < \num{1.4e-3}$ for large mass splittings \cite{collaborationSearchNumu>nueOscillations2003}. MiniBooNE LEE was explored by many similar experiments; particularly interesting is the MicroBooNE experiment, MiniBooNE's immediate successor, collecting data from BNB upstream of MiniBooNE at \SI{472}{m} from the neutrino source. The technology is that of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber \cite{rubbiaLiquidArgonTime1977}, which I will describe in great detail later in \autoref{chap:icarus_detector} \todo[green]{2nd chapter}. MicroBooNE found no evidence of the signal excess found by MiniBooNE, looking at multiple final state topologies \cite{collaborationSearchExcessElectron2022}. These findings were later proved to not be definitive \cite{arguellesMicroBooNE$n_e$Interpretation2022} since the rejection of the MiniBooNE claim was not model-independent. 

At long baseline multiple experiments also investigated LNSD and MiniBooNE LEE anomalies. This is, for example, the case of the ICARUS and OPERA (CNGS1/2) experiments, collecting neutrinos produced from the S$\Pp\PAp$S in the CNGS beam at an energy of $\sim \SI{17}{GeV}$ and placed at baselines of \SI{730}{km}. Both the ICARUS \cite{antonelloSearchAnomaliesNeappearance2013, antonelloConclusiveConsiderationsComparison2015} and the OPERA \cite{agafonovaNewResultsNm2013} experiments performed analysis excluding much of the parameter space of the MiniBooNE experiment, especially in the high mixing angle region, showing \begin{align}
    \sin^22\theta &< \num{6.8e-3}\ (\num{1.52e-2})\ \text{at \SI{90}{\percent} (\SI{99}{\percent}) CL,} && \text{(ICARUS)}\\
    \sin^22\theta &< \num{7.2e-3}\ \text{at \SI{90}{\percent} CL.} && \text{(OPERA)}
\end{align}

Great tension is also found in very short baselines with reactor experiments. Those look for excess or deficits in the electron antineutrino flux, so it is clear that a correct evaluation of the expected flux of antineutrinos is core for such measurement. For reactor experiments, such a prerequisite is not known with great accuracy and is affected by many systematic uncertainties. Reactor experiments are mostly not sensitive to the spectrum of energies but are considered ``rate'' experiments, counting the overall excess of the flux, or ``spectral'' experiments, looking at the energy --- or $E/L$ --- spectrum. Particularly interesting are the Bugey \cite{declaisSearchNeutrinoOscillations1995}, NEOS \cite{koSterileNeutrinoSearch2017}, PROSPECT \cite{andriamiradoImprovedShortBaselineNeutrino2020} and STEREO \cite{almazanSTEREONeutrinoSpectrum2023} experiments, which found no evidence of oscillation. NEOS was followed in its analysis by the RENO, an independent detector sharing the same source, suppressing many of the uncertainties in the flux model, and improving on the results, narrowing even more the parameter space \cite{atifSearchSterileNeutrino2022}. 

In the reactor neutrino experiment landscape, an interesting result is that of the Neutrino-4 experiment. This experiment detected electron antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor SM-3 in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, using a detector with the ability to investigate the \qtyrange{6}{10}{m} range of baseline distances from the reactor. This experiment gave clear evidence of $L/E \simeq \qtyrange{1}{3}{m/MeV}$ oscillation, with a sensitivity of roughly $3\sigma$, that is in great agreement with GA experiments such as GALLEX and SAGE --- quite unique, since most of the RAA experiments are in tension with GA experiments \cite{maltoniEVSterileNeutrinos2024}. When combined with GALLEX, SAGE and BEST its statistical significance rises to $5.8\sigma$ \cite{serebrovResultNeutrino4Experiment2023}. The result of the Neutrino-4 experiment fits well the $3+1$ scenario, leading to a mass splitting of $\Delta m^2_{41} = \mathrm{7.30 (0.13)_{stat}\ (1.16)_{syst}}\ \si{eV^2} = \SI{7.30+-1.17}{eV^2}$ and an amplitude of $\sin^22\theta = \num{0.36\pm0.12}\mathrm{\ (stat)}$. 

As I already mentioned, GA experiments differ and are in tension with most of the other experimental searches, requiring a greater mixing angle. This anomaly, found by GALLEX and SAGE and made stronger by the BEST experiment \cite{giuntiGalliumAnomalyCritical2022}, leading to a best fit point $(\Delta m^2, \sin^22\theta) \simeq (\SI{1.25}{eV^2}, \num{0.32})$. The overlap with the allowed regions of the LNSD and MiniBooNE LEE results are negligible, and the overlap with RAA is possible with $\sin^22\theta\sim0.2$. 

Another experimental search is in the $\PGnGm$-disappearance and $\PGne$-appearance channels. These have been the channels explored by NOvA \cite{collaborationSearchActivesterileNeutrino2017}, MINOS \cite{adamsonSearchSterileNeutrinos2019}. Additional searches in those channels have been performed with data from the IceCube detector, and interesting results will come from the JUNO future neutrino experiment \cite{dentlerUpdatedGlobalAnalysis2018}. 

\autoref{fig:all_experimental_searches} shows a summary of all the experiments that provided exclusion areas in the parameter space, with the baseline at which they are detecting neutrinos and their energy range superimposed to the oscillation maxima in the hypothesis of a two-flavour oscillation scenario.

In this very complicated picture stands the Short-Baseline-Neutrino program \cite{acciarriProposalThreeDetector2015}, to which the next chapter is briefly devoted. In \autoref{fig:sensitivity_plots} are shown the updated allowed and excluded parameter regions from the combination of the multiple ocillation channels and multiple experimental inputs. This experiment will probe the sterile neutrino scenario with increased sensitivity up to $5\sigma$, exploiting a two-detector experimental search in both the $\PGne$-appearance and $\PGnGm$-disappearance channels.
