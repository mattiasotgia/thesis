The search is motivated by two ``anomalous'' radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III that appear inconsistent with the standard model of particle physics. Using simulations of both regular cosmic-ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure has been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the corresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1--33]~EeV. One event has been found in the search period between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, consistent with an expected background of                                0.27                 {\textpm}                 0.12                              events from misreconstructed cosmic-ray showers.

  abstract = {The Russian-American experiment SAGE began to measure the solar neutrino capture rate with a target of gallium metal in December 1989. Measurements have continued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. In this article we present the experimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in December 2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the period of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through December 2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of 65.4+3.1-3.0 (stat) +2.6-2.8 (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the results of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is now 66.1{\textpm}3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been combined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test of SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of observed to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured rates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87{\textpm}0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for neutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been overestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard solar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga in the range of 63 SNU to 66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4\%, in good agreement with experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in the Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be {$\phi\odotpp$}=(6.0{\textpm}0.8){\texttimes}1010/(cm2 s), which agrees well with the {$pp$} flux predicted by the standard solar model. Finally, we make several tests and show that the data are consistent with the assumption that the solar neutrino production rate is constant in time.},

  abstract = {The T2K experiment has observed electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam produced 295 km from the Super-Kamiokande detector with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV. A total of 28 electron neutrino events were detected with an energy distribution consistent with an appearance signal, corresponding to a significance of 7.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ when compared to 4.92 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.55 expected background events. In the PMNS mixing model, the electron neutrino appearance signal depends on several parameters including three mixing angles \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{12\}\$, \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{23\}\$, \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{13\}\$, a mass difference \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2\_\{32\}\$ and a CP violating phase \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CP\}\}\$.

When combining the result with the current best knowledge of oscillation parameters including the world average value of \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{13\}\$ from reactor experiments, some values of \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CP\}\}\$ are disfavored at the 90\% CL.},

  abstract = {The ICARUS collaboration employed the 760-ton T600 detector in a successful 3-year physics run at the underground LNGS laboratory, performing a sensitive search for LSND-like anomalous \$\${\textbackslash}nu \_e\$\$appearance in the CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso beam, which contributed to the constraints on the allowed neutrino oscillation parameters to a narrow region around 1 eV\$\${\textasciicircum}2\$\$. After a significant overhaul at CERN, the T600 detector has been installed at Fermilab. In 2020 the cryogenic commissioning began with detector cool down, liquid argon filling and recirculation. ICARUS then started its operations collecting the first neutrino events from the booster neutrino beam (BNB) and the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam off-axis, which were used to test the ICARUS event selection, reconstruction and analysis algorithms. ICARUS successfully completed its commissioning phase in June 2022. The first goal of the ICARUS data taking will be a study to either confirm or refute the claim by Neutrino-4 short-baseline reactor experiment. ICARUS will also perform measurement of neutrino cross sections with the NuMI beam and several Beyond Standard Model searches. After the first year of operations, ICARUS will search for evidence of sterile neutrinos jointly with the Short-Baseline Near Detector, within the Short-Baseline Neutrino program. In this paper, the main activities carried out during the overhauling and installation phases are highlighted. Preliminary technical results from the ICARUS commissioning data with the BNB and NuMI beams are presented both in terms of performance of all ICARUS subsystems and of capability to select and reconstruct neutrino events.},

  abstract = {The development and operation of liquid-argon time-projection chambers for neutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition in order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology. Whereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded events, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic solution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid the design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes the use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which individual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology. Many tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and, together, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper describes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools used to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE detector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are presented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state event topologies.},

  abstract = {A Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program of three LAr-TPC detectors located along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab is presented. This new SBN Program will deliver a rich and compelling physics opportunity, including the ability to resolve a class of experimental anomalies in neutrino physics and to perform the most sensitive search to date for sterile neutrinos at the eV mass-scale through both appearance and disappearance oscillation channels. Using data sets of 6.6e20 protons on target (P.O.T.) in the LAr1-ND and ICARUS T600 detectors plus 13.2e20 P.O.T. in the MicroBooNE detector, we estimate that a search for muon neutrino to electron neutrino appearance can be performed with {\textasciitilde}5 sigma sensitivity for the LSND allowed (99\% C.L.) parameter region. In this proposal for the SBN Program, we describe the physics analysis, the conceptual design of the LAr1-ND detector, the design and refurbishment of the T600 detector, the necessary infrastructure required to execute the program, and a possible reconfiguration of the BNB target and horn system to improve its performance for oscillation searches.},

  abstract = {This white paper provides a comprehensive review of our present understanding of experimental neutrino anomalies that remain unresolved, charting the progress achieved over the last decade at the experimental and phenomenological level, and sets the stage for future programmatic prospects in addressing those anomalies. It is purposed to serve as a guiding and motivational "encyclopedic" reference, with emphasis on needs and options for future exploration that may lead to the ultimate resolution of the anomalies. We see the main experimental, analysis, and theory-driven thrusts that will be essential to achieving this goal being: 1) Cover all anomaly sectors -- given the unresolved nature of all four canonical anomalies, it is imperative to support all pillars of a diverse experimental portfolio, source, reactor, decay-at-rest, decay-in-flight, and other methods/sources, to provide complementary probes of and increased precision for new physics explanations; 2) Pursue diverse signatures -- it is imperative that experiments make design and analysis choices that maximize sensitivity to as broad an array of these potential new physics signatures as possible; 3) Deepen theoretical engagement -- priority in the theory community should be placed on development of standard and beyond standard models relevant to all four short-baseline anomalies and the development of tools for efficient tests of these models with existing and future experimental datasets; 4) Openly share data -- Fluid communication between the experimental and theory communities will be required, which implies that both experimental data releases and theoretical calculations should be publicly available; and 5) Apply robust analysis techniques -- Appropriate statistical treatment is crucial to assess the compatibility of data sets within the context of any given model.},

  abstract = {Neutrinos are the most abundant fundamental matter particles in the Universe and play a crucial role in particle physics and cosmology. Neutrino oscillation, discovered about 25 years ago, reveals that the three known species mix with each other. Anomalous results from reactor and radioactive-source experiments suggest a possible fourth neutrino state, the sterile neutrino, which does not interact via the weak force. The KATRIN experiment, primarily designed to measure the neutrino mass via tritium \${\textbackslash}beta\$-decay, also searches for sterile neutrinos suggested by these anomalies. A sterile-neutrino signal would appear as a distortion in the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-decay energy spectrum, characterized by a discontinuity in curvature (kink) related to the sterile-neutrino mass. This signature, which depends only on the shape of the spectrum rather than its absolute normalization, offers a robust, complementary approach to reactor experiments. KATRIN examined the energy spectrum of 36 million tritium \${\textbackslash}beta\$-decay electrons recorded in 259 measurement days within the last 40 electronvolt below the endpoint. The results exclude a substantial part of the parameter space suggested by the gallium anomaly and challenge the Neutrino-4 claim. Together with other neutrino-disappearance experiments, KATRIN probes sterile-to-active mass splittings from a fraction of an electron-volt squared to several hundred electron-volts squared, excluding light sterile neutrinos with mixing angles above a few percent.},

  abstract = {For most of their existence, stars are fuelled by the fusion of hydrogen into helium. Fusion proceeds via two processes that are well understood theoretically: the proton--proton (pp) chain and the carbon--nitrogen--oxygen (CNO) cycle1,2. Neutrinos that are emitted along such fusion processes in the solar core are the only direct probe of the deep interior of the Sun. A complete spectroscopic study of neutrinos from the pp chain, which produces about 99 per cent~of the solar energy, has been performed previously3; however, there has been no reported experimental evidence of the CNO cycle. Here we report the direct observation, with a high statistical significance, of neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle in the Sun. This experimental evidence was obtained using the highly radiopure, large-volume, liquid-scintillator detector of Borexino, an experiment located at the underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The main experimental challenge was to identify the excess signal---only a few counts per day above the background per 100 tonnes of target---that is attributed to interactions of the CNO neutrinos. Advances in the thermal stabilization of the detector over the last five years enabled us to develop a method to constrain the rate of bismuth-210 contaminating the scintillator. In the CNO cycle, the fusion of hydrogen is catalysed by carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and so its rate---as well as the flux of emitted CNO neutrinos---depends directly on the abundance of these elements in the solar core. This result therefore paves the way towards a direct measurement of the solar metallicity using CNO neutrinos. Our findings quantify the relative contribution of CNO fusion in the Sun to be of the order of 1~per cent; however, in massive stars, this is the dominant process of energy production. This work provides experimental evidence of the primary mechanism for the stellar conversion of hydrogen into helium in the Universe.},

  abstract = {Anomalies in past neutrino measurements have led to the discovery that these particles have non-zero mass and oscillate between their three flavours when they propagate. In the 2010s, similar anomalies observed in the antineutrino spectra emitted by nuclear reactors have triggered the hypothesis of the existence of a supplementary neutrino state that would be sterile, that is, not interacting by means of the weak interaction1. The STEREO experiment2--6 was designed to investigate this conjecture, which would potentially extend the standard model of particle physics. Here we present an analysis of the full set of data generated by STEREO, confirming observed anomalies while rejecting the hypothesis of a light sterile neutrino. Installed at the Institut Laue--Langevin (ILL) research reactor, STEREO accurately measures the antineutrino energy spectrum associated to the fission of 235U. The segmentation of the detector and its very short distance to the compact core are crucial properties of STEREO for our analysis. The measured antineutrino energy spectrum suggests that anomalies originate from biases in the nuclear experimental data used for the predictions7,8. Our result supports the neutrino content of the standard model and establishes a new reference for the 235U antineutrino energy spectrum. We anticipate that this result will allow progress towards finer tests of the fundamental properties of neutrinos but also to benchmark models and nuclear data of interest for reactor physics9,10 and for observations of astrophysical or geoneutrinos11,12.},

The ICARUS T600 detector is the largest LAr TPC ever built, with a size of about 500tons of fully imaging mass. The design and assembly of the detector relied on industrial support and represents the applications of concepts matured in laboratory tests to the kton scale. The ICARUS T600 was commissioned for a technical run that lasted about 3 months. During this period all the detector features were extensively tested with an exposure to cosmic-rays at surface with a resulting data collection of about 30000 events. The detector was developed as the first element of a modular design. Thanks to the concept of modularity, it will be possible to realize a detector with several ktons active mass, to act as an observatory for astroparticle and neutrino physics at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory and a second-generation nucleon decay experiment. In this paper a description of the ICARUS T600 is given, detailing its design specifications, assembly procedures and acceptance tests. Commissioning procedures and results of the technical run are also reported, as well as results from the off-line event reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Cloud chamber photographs at 4300 meters elevation show positive and negative electron tracks similar to those observed at sea-level, but positive-negative electron showers occur more frequently and, in general, consist of more numerous tracks. Showers of 2-4 tracks, 5-10 tracks, and 11-100 tracks occur respectively, 8.6, 21 and 29 times as frequently per unit time at 4300 meters as they do near sea-level. Further measurements on the energy loss in lead of electrons up to 400 MEV, are given. They show that in this range of energies the energy loss in lead is roughly proportional to the incident energy. About one percent of the exposures on Pike's Peak reveal the presence of strongly ionizing particles which in most cases seem to be protons. The proportion of such tracks is considerably greater than at Pasadena. These heavy tracks in general bear only little relation in direction to that of the incoming beam, and usually arise from a type of nuclear disintegration not heretofore observed. The energies of these heavily ionizing particles may rise to values so high as 150 MEV, thus indicating that the source of the particle energies is in the cosmic rays.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed report on sterile neutrino oscillation and U-235 antineutrino energy spectrum measurement results from the PROSPECT experiment at the highly enriched High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 96 calendar days of data taken at an average baseline distance of 7.9 m from the center of the 85 MW HFIR core, the PROSPECT detector has observed more than 50,000 interactions of antineutrinos produced in beta decays of U-235 fission products. New limits on the oscillation of antineutrinos to light sterile neutrinos have been set by comparing the detected energy spectra of ten reactor-detector baselines between 6.7 and 9.2 meters. Measured differences in energy spectra between baselines show no statistically significant indication of antineutrinos to sterile neutrino oscillation and disfavor the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly best-fit point at the 2.5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level. The reported U-235 antineutrino energy spectrum measurement shows excellent agreement with energy spectrum models generated via conversion of the measured U-235 beta spectrum, with a \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$/DOF of 31/31. PROSPECT is able to disfavor at 2.4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level the hypothesis that U-235 antineutrinos are solely responsible for spectrum discrepancies between model and data obtained at commercial reactor cores. A data-model deviation in PROSPECT similar to that observed by commercial core experiments is preferred with respect to no observed deviation, at a 2.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level.},

  abstract = {The ICARUS collaboration has demonstrated, following the operation of a 600~ton (T600) detector at shallow depth, that the technique based on liquid argon time projection chambers is now mature. The study of rare events, not contemplated in the standard model, can greatly benefit from the use of this kind of detectors. In particular, a deeper understanding of atmospheric neutrino properties will be obtained thanks to the unprecedented quality of the data ICARUS provides. However if we concentrate on the T600 performance, most of the {$\nu\mu$} charged current sample will be partially contained, due to the reduced dimensions of the detector. In this article, we address the problem of how well we can determine the kinematics of events having partially contained tracks. The analysis of a large sample of atmospheric muons collected during the T600 test run demonstrates that, in case the recorded track is at least one meter long, the muon momentum can be reconstructed by an algorithm that measures the multiple Coulomb scattering along the particle's path. Moreover, we show that momentum resolution can be improved by almost a factor two using an algorithm based on the Kalman filtering technique.},

The ratio of the observed to expected number of antineutrinos at the far hall is \$R=0.940{\textbackslash}pm 0.011(\{{\textbackslash}rm stat\}) {\textbackslash}pm 0.004(\{{\textbackslash}rm syst\})\$.

The present analysis is based on a total sample of 1995 events of CNGS neutrino interactions, which corresponds to an almost doubled sample with respect to the previously published result. Four clear {$\nu$}eevents have been visually identified over the full sample, compared with an expectation of 6.4{\textpm}0.9 events from conventional sources. The result is compatible with the absence of additional anomalous contributions. At~90~\% and 99~\% confidence levels, the limits to possible oscillated events are 3.7 and 8.3 respectively. The corresponding limit to oscillation probability becomes consequently 3.4{\texttimes}10-3 and 7.6{\texttimes}10-3, respectively. The present result confirms, with an improved sensitivity, the early result already published by the ICARUS Collaboration.},

This is of huge importance for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, not only because of the potential discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model, but also because the lessons we will learn about neutrino-nucleus interactions will be crucial for the worldwide neutrino program. MicroBooNE has recently released results that appear to disfavor several explanations of the MiniBooNE anomaly. Here, we show quantitatively that MicroBooNE results, while a promising start, unquestionably do not probe the full parameter space of sterile neutrino models hinted at by MiniBooNE and other data, nor do they probe the \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ interpretation of the MiniBooNE excess in a model-independent way.

  abstract = {We have presented a review of the properties of neutrinos and their interactions with matter. The different (anti)neutrino processes like the quasielastic scattering, inelastic production of mesons and hyperons, and the deep inelastic scattering from the free nucleons are discussed and the results for the scattering cross sections are presented. The polarization observables for the leptons and hadrons produced in the final state, in the case of quasielastic scattering, are also studied. The importance of nuclear medium effects in the low, intermediate and high energy regions, in the above processes along with the processes of the coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, coherent meson production, and trident production, have been highlighted. In some cases the results of the cross sections are also given and compared with the available experimental data as well as with the predictions in the different theoretical models. This study would be helpful in understanding the (anti)neutrino interaction cross section with matter in the few GeV energy region relevant to the next generation experiments like DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and other experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We have emphasized the need of better theoretical models for some of these processes for studying the nuclear medium effects in nuclei.},

  abstract = {The uncertainties that affect the prediction of solar neutrino fluxes are evaluated with the aid of standard solar models. The uncertainties are determined from available data for all measured quantities that are known to affect significantly the neutrino fluxes; these include nuclear reaction rates, the solar constant, and the primordial surface composition of the sun. Uncertainties in theoretical quantities (such as the stellar opacity, the equation of state, and the rate of the proton-proton reaction) are estimated from the range of values in published state-of-the-art calculations. The uncertainty in each neutrino flux that is caused by a specified uncertainty in any of the parameters is evaluated with the aid of a series of standard solar models that were constructed for this purpose; the results are expressed in terms of the logarithmic partial derivative of each flux with respect to each parameter. The effects on the neutrino fluxes of changing individual parameters by large amounts can usually be estimated to satisfactory accuracy by making use of the tabulated partial derivatives. An overall "effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} level of uncertainty" is defined using the requirement that the true value should lie within the estimated range unless someone has made a mistake. Effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} levels of uncertainty, as well as best estimates, are determined for the following possible detectors of solar neutrinos: 2H, 7Li, 37Cl, 71Ga, 79Br, 81Br, 97Mo, 98Mo, 115In, and electron-neutrino scattering. The most important sources of uncertainty in the predicted capture rates are identified and discussed for each detector separately. For the 37Cl detector, the predicted capture rate is 7.6{\textpm}3.3 (effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} errors) SNU. The measured production rate is (Cleveland, Davis, and Rowley, 1981) 2.1{\textpm}0.3 SNU (1⁢{$\sigma$} error). For a 71Ga detector, the expected capture rate is 106 (1+0.12-0.08) SNU (also effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} errors). The relatively small uncertainty quoted for the 71Ga detector is a direct result of the fact that 71Ga is primarily sensitive to neutrinos from the basic proton-proton reaction, the rate of which is determined largely by the observed solar luminosity. The Caltech and Munster measured values for the cross-section factor for the reaction 3He({$A$},{$\gamma$})7Be are inconsistent with each other. The capture rates quoted above were obtained using the Caltech value for the cross-section factor. If the Munster value is used instead, then the predicted capture rate for the 37Cl experiment is 4.95{\textpm}2.1 SNU (effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} errors) and, for the 71Ga experiment, 96.7 (1+0.12-0.08) SNU (effective 3⁢{$\sigma$} errors). In order for the best-estimate value to agree with the observation of Davis (1978) of 2 SNU for the 37Cl experiment, the cross-section factor {$S$}34⁡(0) would have to be reduced by about 15⁢{$\sigma$} to less than the Caltech value, i.e. to 7⁢{$\sigma$} less than the Munster value. The characteristics of the standard solar model, constructed with the best available nuclear parameters, solar opacity, and equation of state, are presented in detail. The computational methods by which this and similar models were obtained are also described briefly. The primordial helium abundance inferred with the aid of standard solar models is {$Y$} =0.25 {\textpm}0.01. The complementary relation between observations of solar neutrinos and of the normal modes of oscillation of the sun is examined. It is shown that the splitting of the observed large-{$n$}, small-{$l$}, {$p$}-mode (five minute) oscillations of the sun primarily originates in the outer ten percent of the solar mass, while the neutrinos from 8B beta decay originate primarily in the inner five percent of the solar mass. The solar luminosity, and the flux of neutrinos from the proton-proton reaction, come mostly from an intermediate region.}

  abstract = {The Baksan Experiment on Sterile Transitions (BEST) probes the gallium anomaly and its possible connections to oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos. Based on the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope (GGNT) technology of the SAGE experiment, BEST employs two zones of liquid Ga target to explore neutrino oscillations on the meter scale. Oscillations on this short scale could produce deficits in the \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge production rates within the two zones, as well as a possible rate difference between the zones. From July 5th to October 13th 2019, the two-zone target was exposed to a primarily monoenergetic, 3.4-MCi \${\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$Cr neutrino source 10 times for a total of 20 independent \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge extractions from the two Ga targets. The \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge production rates from the neutrino source were measured from July 2019 to March 2020. At the end of these measurements, the counters were filled with \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge doped gas and calibrated during November 2020. In this paper, results from the BEST sterile neutrino oscillation experiment are presented in details. The ratio of the measured \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge production rates to the predicted rates for the inner and the outer target volumes are calculated from the known neutrino capture cross section. Comparable deficits in the measured ratios relative to predicted values are found for both zones, with the \$4 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ deviations from unity consistent with the previously reported gallium anomaly. If interpreted in the context of neutrino oscillations, the deficits give best fit oscillation parameters of \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2=3.3{\textasciicircum}\{+{\textbackslash}infty\}\_\{-2.3\}\$ eV\${\textasciicircum}2\$ and sin\${\textasciicircum}2 2{\textbackslash}theta=0.42{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.17\}\$, consistent with \${\textbackslash}nu\_e {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}nu\_s\$ oscillations governed by a surprisingly large mixing angle.},

The present paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the status of light sterile neutrino searches in mid-2019: we discuss not only the basic experimental approaches and sensitivities of reactor, source, atmospheric, and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments but also the complementary bounds arising from direct neutrino mass experiments and cosmological observations. Moreover, we review current results from global oscillation analyses that include the constraints set by running reactor and atmospheric neutrino experiments. They permit to set tighter bounds on the active-sterile oscillation parameters but as yet are not able to provide a definite conclusion on the existence of eV-scale sterile neutrinos.},

We explore SBN's sensitivity to those phases for the (3+2) scenario through the currently planned neutrino beam running, and investigate potential improvements through additional antineutrino beam running. We show that, if antineutrino exposure is considered, for maximal values of the (3+2) CP-violating phase \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{54\}\$, SBN could be the first experiment to directly observe \${\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ hints of CP violation associated with an extended lepton sector.},

  abstract = {This paper contains an expository discussion of the chi square test of goodness of fit, intended for the student and user of statistical theory rather than for the expert. Part I describes the historical development of the distribution theory on which the test rests. Research bearing on the practical application of the test--in particular on the minimum expected number per class and the construction of classes--is discussed in Part II. Some varied opinions about the extent to which the test actually is useful to the scientist are presented in Part III. Part IV outlines a number of tests that have been proposed as substitutes for the chi square test (the \${\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2\$ test, the smooth test, the likelihood ratio test) and Part V a number of supplementary tests (the run test, tests based on low moments, subdivision of chi square into components).},

  abstract = {The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.},

The experiment took data from 2008 to 2012 in the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso beam. The observation of \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}\$ appearance, achieved with four candidate events in a sub-sample of the data, was previously reported. In this paper, a fifth \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}\$ candidate event, found in an enlarged data sample, is described. Together with a further reduction of the expected background, the candidate events detected so far allow assessing the discovery of \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}\$ oscillations in appearance mode with a significance larger than 5 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

  abstract = {The ICARUS collaboration employed the 760-ton T600 detector in a successful three-year physics run at the underground LNGS laboratory studying neutrino oscillations with the CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso beam (CNGS) and searching for atmospheric neutrino interactions. ICARUS performed a sensitive search for LSND-like anomalous \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ appearance in the CNGS beam, which contributed to the constraints on the allowed parameters to a narrow region around 1 eV\${\textasciicircum}2\$, where all the experimental results can be coherently accommodated at 90\% C.L.. After a significant overhaul at CERN, the T600 detector has been installed at Fermilab. In 2020, cryogenic commissioning began with detector cool down, liquid argon filling and recirculation. ICARUS has started operations and successfully completed its commissioning phase, collecting the first neutrino events from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam off-axis, which were used to test the ICARUS event selection, reconstruction and analysis algorithms. The first goal of the ICARUS data taking will then be a study to either confirm or refute the claim by Neutrino-4 short baseline reactor experiment both in the \${\textbackslash}nu\_{\textbackslash}mu\$ channel with the BNB and in the \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ with NuMI. ICARUS will also address other fundamental studies such as neutrino cross sections with the NuMI beam and a number of Beyond Standard Model searches. After the first year of operations, ICARUS will commence its search for evidence of a sterile neutrino jointly with the Short Baseline Near Detector, within the Short-Baseline Neutrino program.},

  abstract = {Solar neutrinos from the decay of \${\textasciicircum}8\$B have been detected at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) via the charged current (CC) reaction on deuterium and by the elastic scattering (ES) of electrons. The CC reaction is sensitive exclusively to nu\_e's, while the ES reaction also has a small sensitivity to nu\_mu's and nu\_tau's. The flux of nu\_e's from {\textasciicircum}8B decay measured by the CC reaction rate is {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}CC(nu\_e) = 1.75 +/- 0.07 (stat)+0.12/-0.11 (sys.) +/- 0.05(theor) x 10{\textasciicircum}6 /cm{\textasciicircum}2 s. Assuming no flavor transformation, the flux inferred from the ES reaction rate is {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}ES(nu\_x) = 2.39+/-0.34 (stat.)+0.16\vphantom\{\}/-0.14 (sys) x 10{\textasciicircum}6 /cm{\textasciicircum}2 s. Comparison of {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}CC(nu\_e) to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration's precision value of {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}ES({\textbackslash}nu\_x) yields a 3.3 sigma difference, providing evidence that there is a non-electron flavor active neutrino component in the solar flux. The total flux of active {\textasciicircum}8B neutrinos is thus determined to be 5.44 +/-0.99 x 10{\textasciicircum}6/cm{\textasciicircum}2 s, in close agreement with the predictions of solar models.},

  abstract = {The T2K experiment presents new measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters using \$19.7(16.3){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{20\}\$ protons on target (POT) in (anti-)neutrino mode at the far detector (FD). Compared to the previous analysis, an additional \$4.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{20\}\$ POT neutrino data was collected at the FD. Significant improvements were made to the analysis methodology, with the near-detector analysis introducing new selections and using more than double the data. Additionally, this is the first T2K oscillation analysis to use NA61/SHINE data on a replica of the T2K target to tune the neutrino flux model, and the neutrino interaction model was improved to include new nuclear effects and calculations. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses are presented, including results on \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{13\}\$ and the impact of priors on the \${\textbackslash}delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CP\}\$ measurement. Both analyses prefer the normal mass ordering and upper octant of \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{23\}\$ with a nearly maximally CP-violating phase. Assuming the normal ordering and using the constraint on \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{13\}\$ from reactors, \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{23\}=0.561{\textasciicircum}\{+0.021\}\_\{-0.032\}\$ using Feldman--Cousins corrected intervals, and \${\textbackslash}Delta\{\}m{\textasciicircum}2\_\{32\}=2.494\_\{-0.058\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.041\}{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eV{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ using constant \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ intervals.

  abstract = {We present the results of measurements of the solar neutrino capture rate in gallium metal by the Russian-American Gallium Experiment SAGE during slightly more than half of a 22-year cycle of solar activity. Combined analysis of the data of 92 runs during the 12-year period January 1990 through December 2001 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of 70.8 +5.3/-5.2 (stat.) +3.7/-3.2 (syst.) SNU. This represents only slightly more than half of the predicted standard solar model rate of 128 SNU. We give the results of new runs beginning in April 1998 and the results of combined analysis of all runs since 1990 during yearly, monthly, and bimonthly periods. Using a simple analysis of the SAGE results combined with those from all other solar neutrino experiments, we estimate the electron neutrino pp flux that reaches the Earth to be (4.6 +/- 1.1) E10/(cm{\textasciicircum}2-s). Assuming that neutrinos oscillate to active flavors the pp neutrino flux emitted in the solar fusion reaction is approximately (7.7 +/- 1.8) E10/(cm{\textasciicircum}2-s), in agreement with the standard solar model calculation of (5.95 +/- 0.06) E10/(cm{\textasciicircum}2-s).},

With differing signal topologies, statistics, backgrounds, reconstruction algorithms, and analysis approaches, the results are found to be consistent with the nominal electron neutrino rate expectations from the Booster Neutrino Beam and no excess of electron neutrino events is observed.},

  abstract = {An analysis of solar neutrino data from the fourth phase of Super-Kamiokande{\textasciitilde}(SK-IV) from October 2008 to May 2018 is performed and the results are presented. The observation time of the data set of SK-IV corresponds to \$2970\${\textasciitilde}days and the total live time for all four phases is \$5805\${\textasciitilde}days. For more precise solar neutrino measurements, several improvements are applied in this analysis: lowering the data acquisition threshold in May 2015, further reduction of the spallation background using neutron clustering events, precise energy reconstruction considering the time variation of the PMT gain. The observed number of solar neutrino events in \$3.49\$--\$19.49\$ MeV electron kinetic energy region during SK-IV is \$65,443{\textasciicircum}\{+390\}\_\{-388\}{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}mathrm\{stat.\}){\textbackslash}pm 925{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}mathrm\{syst.\})\$ events. Corresponding \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciicircum}\{8\}B\}\$ solar neutrino flux is \$(2.314 {\textbackslash}pm 0.014{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{(stat.)\} {\textbackslash}pm 0.040 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{(syst.)\}) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, assuming a pure electron-neutrino flavor component without neutrino oscillations. The flux combined with all SK phases up to SK-IV is \$(2.336 {\textbackslash}pm 0.011{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{(stat.)\} {\textbackslash}pm 0.043 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{(syst.)\}) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. Based on the neutrino oscillation analysis from all solar experiments, including the SK \$5805\${\textasciitilde}days data set, the best-fit neutrino oscillation parameters are \${\textbackslash}rm\{sin{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}theta\_\{12,{\textbackslash},solar\}\} = 0.306 {\textbackslash}pm 0.013 \$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{21,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{solar\}\} = (6.10{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.95\}\_\{-0.81\}) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{eV\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$, with a deviation of about 1.5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ from the \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{21\}\$ parameter obtained by KamLAND. The best-fit neutrino oscillation parameters obtained from all solar experiments and KamLAND are \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}theta\_\{12,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{global\}\} = 0.307 {\textbackslash}pm 0.012 \$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{21,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{global\}\} = (7.50{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.19\}\_\{-0.18\}) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{eV\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$.},

The additional statistics allow several studies to address questions on the source of the excess. First, we provide two-dimensional plots in visible energy and cosine of the angle of the outgoing lepton, which can provide valuable input to models for the event excess. Second, we test whether the excess may arise from photons that enter the detector from external events or photons exiting the detector from \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}0\$ decays in two model independent ways. Beam timing information shows that almost all of the excess is in time with neutrinos that interact in the detector. The radius distribution shows that the excess is distributed throughout the volume, while tighter cuts on the fiducal volume increase the significance of the excess. We conclude that models of the event excess based on entering and exiting photons are disfavored.},

  abstract = {Neutrinos, being the only fermions in the Standard Model of Particle Physics that do not possess electromagnetic or color charges, have the unique opportunity to communicate with fermions outside the Standard Model through mass mixing. Such Standard Model-singlet fermions are generally referred to as "sterile neutrinos''. In this review article, we discuss the theoretical and experimental motivation for sterile neutrinos, as well as their phenomenological consequences. With the benefit of hindsight in 2020, we point out potentially viable and interesting ideas. We focus in particular on sterile neutrinos that are light enough to participate in neutrino oscillations, but we also comment on the benefits of introducing heavier sterile states. We discuss the phenomenology of eV-scale sterile neutrinos in terrestrial experiments and in cosmology, we survey the global data, and we highlight various intriguing anomalies. We also expose the severe tension that exists between different data sets and prevents a consistent interpretation of the global data in at least the simplest sterile neutrino models. We discuss non-minimal scenarios that may alleviate some of this tension. We briefly review the status of keV-scale sterile neutrinos as dark matter and the possibility of explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe through leptogenesis driven by yet heavier sterile neutrinos.},

  abstract = {We discuss the possibility to explain the anomalies in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in terms of sterile neutrinos. We work in a 3+1 framework and pay special attention to recent new data from reactor experiments, IceCube and MINOS+. We find that results from the DANSS and NEOS reactor experiments support the sterile neutrino explanation of the reactor anomaly, based on an analysis that relies solely on the relative comparison of measured reactor spectra. Global data from the \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ disappearance channel favour sterile neutrino oscillations at the \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level with \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2\_\{41\} {\textbackslash}approx 1.3\$ eV\${\textasciicircum}2\$ and \${\textbar}U\_\{e4\}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}approx 0.1\$, even without any assumptions on predicted reactor fluxes. In contrast, the anomalies in the \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ appearance channel (dominated by LSND) are in strong tension with improved bounds on \${\textbackslash}nu\_{\textbackslash}mu\$ disappearance, mostly driven by MINOS+ and IceCube. Under the sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis, the p-value for those data sets being consistent is less than \$2.6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$. Therefore, an explanation of the LSND anomaly in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations in the 3+1 scenario is excluded at the \$4.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. This result is robust with respect to variations in the analysis and used data, in particular it depends neither on the theoretically predicted reactor neutrino fluxes, nor on constraints from any single experiment. Irrespective of the anomalies, we provide updated constraints on the allowed mixing strengths \${\textbar}U\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha 4\}{\textbar}\$ (\${\textbackslash}alpha = e,{\textbackslash}mu,{\textbackslash}tau\$) of active neutrinos with a fourth neutrino mass state in the eV range.},

  abstract = {In order to test the end-to-end operations of gallium solar neutrino experiments, intense electron-capture sources were fabricated to measure the responses of the radiochemical SAGE and GALLEX/GNO detectors to known fluxes of low-energy neutrinos. Such tests were viewed at the time as a cross-check, given the many tests of \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge recovery and counting that had been routinely performed, with excellent results. However, the four \${\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$Cr and \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar source experiments yielded rates below expectations, a result commonly known as the Ga anomaly. As the intensity of the electron-capture sources can be measured to high precision, the neutrino lines they produce are fixed by known atomic and nuclear rates, and the neutrino absorption cross section on \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ga is tightly constrained by the lifetime of \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge, no simple explanation for the anomaly has been found. To check these calibration experiments, a dedicated experiment BEST was performed, utilizing a neutrino source of unprecedented intensity and a detector optimized to increase statistics while providing some information on counting rate as a function of distance from the source. The results BEST obtained are consistent with the earlier solar neutrino calibration experiments, and when combined with those measurements, yield a Ga anomaly with a significance of approximately \$4{\textbackslash}sigma\$, under conservative assumptions. But BEST found no evidence of distance dependence and thus no explicit indication of new physics. In this review we describe the extensive campaigns carried out by SAGE, GALLEX/GNO, and BEST to demonstrate the reliability and precision of their experimental procedures, including \${\textasciicircum}\{71\}\$Ge recovery, counting, and analysis. We also describe efforts to define uncertainties in the neutrino capture cross section. With the results from BEST, an anomaly remains.},

The third mixing angle {\texttheta}23 still suffers from the octant ambiguity, with no clear indication of whether it is larger or smaller than 45{$^\circ$}. The determination of the leptonic CP phase {$\delta$}CP depends on the neutrino mass ordering: for normal ordering the global fit is consistent with CP conservation within 1{$\sigma$}, whereas for inverted ordering CP-violating values of {$\delta$}CP around 270{$^\circ$} are favored against CP conservation at more than 3.6{$\sigma$}. While the present data has in principle 2.5--3{$\sigma$} sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, there are different tendencies in the global data that reduce the discrimination power: T2K and NOvA appearance data individually favor normal ordering, but they are more consistent with each other for inverted ordering. Conversely, the joint determination of \$\$ {\textbackslash}mid {\textbackslash}Delta \{m\}\_\{3{\textbackslash}ell\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mid \$\$from global disappearance data prefers normal ordering. Altogether, the global fit including long-baseline, reactor and IceCube atmospheric data results into an almost equally good fit for both orderings. Only when the {$\chi$}2 table for atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande is added to our {$\chi$}2, the global fit prefers normal ordering with ∆{$\chi$}2 = 6.1. We provide also updated ranges and correlations for the effective parameters sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass from {$\beta$}-decay, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and cosmology.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

  abstract = {We present the results of an updated fit of short-baseline neutrino oscillation data in the framework of 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixing. We first consider {$\nu$}eand \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\}\_e \$\$disappearance in the light of the Gallium and reactor anomalies. We discuss the implications of the recent measurement of the reactor \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\}\_e \$\$spectrum in the NEOS experiment, which shifts the allowed regions of the parameter space towards smaller values of {\textbar}Ue4{\textbar}2. The {$\beta$}-decay constraints of the Mainz and Troitsk experiments allow us to limit the oscillation length between about 2 cm and 7 m at 3{$\sigma$} for neutrinos with an energy of 1 MeV. The corresponding oscillations can be discovered in a model-independent way in ongoing reactor and source experiments by measuring {$\nu$}eand \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\}\_e \$\$disappearance as a function of distance. We then consider the global fit of the data on short-baseline \$\$ \{\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\}\{{\textbackslash}to\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_e\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\} \$\$transitions in the light of the LSND anomaly, taking into account the constraints from \$\$ \{\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_e\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\} \$\$and \$\$ \{\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\} \$\$disappearance experiments, including the recent data of the MINOS and IceCube experiments. The combination of the NEOS constraints on {\textbar}Ue4{\textbar}2 and the MINOS and IceCube constraints on {\textbar}U{$\mu$}4{\textbar}2 lead to an unacceptable appearance-disappearance tension which becomes tolerable only in a pragmatic fit which neglects the MiniBooNE low-energy anomaly. The minimization of the global {$\chi$}2 in the space of the four mixing parameters {$\Delta$}m412,\,{\textbar}Ue4{\textbar}2,\,{\textbar}U{$\mu$}4{\textbar}2,{\enspace}and{\enspace}{\textbar}U{$\tau$}4{\textbar}2 leads to three allowed regions with narrow {$\Delta$}m412widths at {$\Delta$}m412\,{$\approx$}\,1.7 (best-fit), 1.3 (at 2{$\sigma$}), 2.4 (at 3{$\sigma$}) eV2. The effective amplitude of short-baseline \$\$ \{\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\}\{{\textbackslash}to\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_e\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}left(-{\textbackslash}right)\} \$\$oscillations is limited by 0.00048 {$\lessequivlnt$} sin2 2{\textvartheta}e{$\mu\lessequivlnt$} 0.0020 at 3{$\sigma$}. The restrictions of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with respect to our previous global fits are mainly due to the NEOS constraints. We present a comparison of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with the sensitivities of ongoing experiments, which show that it is likely that these experiments will determine in a definitive way if the reactor, Gallium and LSND anomalies are due to active-sterile neutrino oscillations or not.},

In the 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixing scheme, the Gallium Anomaly is in strong tension with the individual and combined bounds of these data sets. In the combined scenario with all available data, the parameter goodness of fit is below 0.042\%, corresponding to a severe tension of 4-5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, or stronger. Therefore, we conclude that one should pursue other possible solutions beyond short-baseline oscillations for the Gallium Anomaly. We also present a new global fit of \${\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ and \${\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}nu\_e\$ disappearance data, showing that there is a 2.6-3.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ preference in favor of short-baseline oscillations, which is driven by an updated analysis of reactor spectral ratio data.},

We show that the reactor rates and the fuel evolution data are consistent with the predictions of the Kurchatov Institute (KI) conversion model and with those of the Estienne-Fallot (EF) summation model, leading to a plausible robust demise of the reactor antineutrino anomaly. We show that the results of several goodness of fit tests favor the KI and EF models over other models that we considered. We also discuss the implications of the new reactor flux models for short-baseline neutrino oscillations due to active-sterile oscillations. We show that reactor data give upper bounds on active-sterile neutrino mixing that are not very different for the reactor flux models under consideration and are in tension with the large mixing required by the Gallium anomaly that has been refreshed by the recent results of the BEST experiment.},

This channel would be a signal of hidden sector models that can address outstanding issues in particle physics such as the strong CP problem and the microphysical origin of dark matter. The search is performed with data collected in the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermilab corresponding to 2.41 {\texttimes}1020 protons-on-target. No new physics signal is observed, and we set world leading limits on heavy QCD axions, as well as for the Higgs portal scalar among dedicated searches. Limits are also presented in a model-independent way applicable to any new physics model predicting the process {$K\rightarrow\pi$}+{$S$}⁡({$\rightarrow\mu$}⁢{$\mu$}), for a LLP {$S$}. This result is the first search for new physics performed with the ICARUS detector at Fermilab. It paves the way for the future program of LLP searches at ICARUS.},

  abstract = {The particle flow approach to calorimetry can provide unprecedented jet energy resolution at a future high energy collider, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC). However, the use of particle flow calorimetry at the proposed multi-TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) poses a number of significant new challenges. At higher jet energies, detector occupancies increase, and it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve energy deposits from individual particles. The experimental conditions at CLIC are also significantly more challenging than those at previous electron-positron colliders, with increased levels of beam-induced backgrounds combined with a bunch spacing of only 0.5 ns. This paper describes the modifications made to the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm to improve the jet energy reconstruction for jet energies above 250 GeV. It then introduces a combination of timing and p\_T cuts that can be applied to reconstructed particles in order to significantly reduce the background. A systematic study is performed to understand the dependence of the jet energy resolution on the jet energy and angle, and the physics performance is assessed via a study of the energy and mass resolution of W and Z particles in the presence of background at CLIC. Finally, the missing transverse momentum resolution is presented, and the fake missing momentum is quantified. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that high granularity particle flow calorimetry leads to a robust and high resolution reconstruction of jet energies and di-jet masses at CLIC.},

  abstract = {Recently new reactor antineutrino spectra have been provided for 235U, 239Pu, 241Pu and 238U, increasing the mean flux by about 3 percent. To good approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments. The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances {$<$}100 m leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of 0.976(0.024). With our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to 0.943(0.023), leading to a deviation from unity at 98.6\% C.L. which we call the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth non-standard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-neutrino data disfavors the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8\% C.L. The oscillation parameters are such that {\textbar}Delta m\_\{new\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbar}{$>$}1.5 eV{\textasciicircum}2 (95\%) and sin{\textasciicircum}2(2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{new\})=0.14(0.08) (95\%).

  abstract = {An excess observed in the accelerator neutrino experiments in the \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}nu\_\{e\}\$ channel at high confidence level (CL) has been interpreted as due to eV-scale sterile neutrino(s). But, it has been suffered from the problem of ``appearance - disappearance tension'' at the similarly high CL because the measurements of the \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$ channel do not observe the expected event number depletion corresponding to the sterile contribution in the appearance channel. We suggest non-unitarity as a simple and natural way of resolving the tension, which leads us to construct the non-unitary \$(3+1)\$ model. With reasonable estimation of the parameters governing non-unitarity, we perform an illustrative analysis to know if the tension is resolved in this model. At the best fit of the appearance signature we have found the unique solution with \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}2 2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{14\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.3\$, which is consistent with the (reactors + Ga) data combined fit. Unexpectedly, our tension-easing mechanism bridges between the two high CL signatures, the BEST and LSND-MiniBooNE anomalies.},

  abstract = {A brief analysis of the result of the Neutrino-4 experiment and the results of other experiments on the search for a sterile neutrino is presented. It is noted that a joint analysis of the results of the Neutrino-4 experiment and the data of the GALLEX, SAGE and BEST experiments confirms the parameters of neutrino oscillations declared by the Neutrino-4 experiment (\${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textasciicircum}2\_\{14\} = 7.3{\textbackslash}text\{eV\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ and \${\textbackslash}sin{\textasciicircum}\{2\}2{\textbackslash}theta\_\{14\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.36\$) and increases the confidence level to \$5.8\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\$. An estimate of the contribution of sterile neutrinos with these parameters to the energy density of the Universe is made. It amounted to 5.3\%. It is discussed that the extension of the neutrino model by introducing two more heavy sterile neutrinos in accordance with the number of types of active neutrinos will make it possible to explain the large-scale structure of the Universe and bring the contribution of sterile neutrinos to the dark matter of the Universe to the level of 27\%. Possible contradictions between the measured sterile neutrino parameters and cosmological constraints are analyzed. It is shown that, based on modern astrophysical data, it is impossible to draw a definite conclusion in favor of the model of three or four neutrinos. It is noted that the introduction of the fourth neutrino removes the Hubble tension problem without contradictions with cosmic microwave background observed by the Planck collaboration. The influence of lepton asymmetry on the comparison of models of three or four neutrinos is considered. An estimate was made for the upper limit of the lepton asymmetry \$L\_e{$<$} 0.02\$. The possibility of the appearance of lepton asymmetry due to CP violation during oscillations into sterile neutrinos is discussed.},

The experimental setup is constructed to measure the flux and spectrum of the reactor antineutrinos as a function of distance to the center of the active zone of the SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia) in the range of 6--12 meters. Using all the collected data, we performed a model-independent analysis to determine the oscillation parameters {$\Delta$}⁢m214 and sin2⁡2⁢{$\theta$}14. The method of coherent summation of measurement results allows us to directly demonstrate the oscillation effect. We present the analysis of possible systematic errors and the MC model of the experiment, which considers the possibility of the effect manifestation at the present precision level. As a result of the analysis, we can conclude that at currently available statistical accuracy, we observe the oscillations at the 2.9⁢{$\sigma$} level with the parameters {$\Delta$}⁢{$m$}214=(7.3{\textpm}0.13st{\textpm}1.16syst) eV2=(7.3{\textpm}1.17) eV2 and sin2⁡2⁢{$\theta$}=0.36{\textpm}0.12stat⁢(2.9⁢{$\sigma$}). Monte Carlo based statistical analysis gave an estimation of the confidence level at 2.7⁢{$\sigma$}. We plan to improve the currently working experimental setup and create a completely new setup in order to increase the accuracy of the experiment by 3 times. We also provide a brief analysis of the general experimental situation in the search for sterile neutrinos.},

  abstract = {Standard solar models (SSMs) provide a reference framework across a number of research fields: solar and stellar models, solar neutrinos, particle physics the most conspicuous among them. The accuracy of the physical description of the global properties of the Sun that SSMs provide has been challenged in the last decade by a number of developments in stellar spectroscopic techniques. Over the same period of time, solar neutrino experiments, and Borexino in particular, have measured the four solar neutrino fluxes from the pp-chains that are associated with 99{\textbackslash}\% of the nuclear energy generated in the Sun. Borexino has also set the most stringent limit on CNO energy generation, only \${\textbackslash}sim 40{\textbackslash}\%\$ larger than predicted by SSMs. More recently, and for the first time, radiative opacity experiments have been performed at conditions that closely resemble those at the base of the solar convective envelope. In this article, we review these developments and discuss the current status of SSMs, including its intrinsic limitations.},

  abstract = {Results are reported from the complete salt phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment in which NaCl was dissolved in the 2H2⁢O (``D2⁢O'') target. The addition of salt enhanced the signal from neutron capture as compared to the pure D2⁢O detector. By making a statistical separation of charged-current events from other types based on event-isotropy criteria, the effective electron recoil energy spectrum has been extracted. In units of 106⁢cm-2⁢s-1, the total flux of active-flavor neutrinos from 8B decay in the Sun is found to be 4.94+0.21-0.21⁢(stat)+0.38-0.34(syst) and the integral flux of electron neutrinos for an undistorted 8B spectrum is 1.68+0.06-0.06⁢(stat)+0.08-0.09(syst); the signal from ({$\nux$},{$e$}) elastic scattering is equivalent to an electron-neutrino flux of 2.35+0.22-0.22⁢(stat)+0.15-0.15(syst). These results are consistent with those expected for neutrino oscillations with the so-called large mixing angle parameters and also with an undistorted spectrum. A search for matter-enhancement effects in the Earth through a possible day-night asymmetry in the charged-current integral rate is consistent with no asymmetry. Including results from other experiments, the best-fit values for two-neutrino mixing parameters are {$\Delta$}⁢m2=(8.0+0.6-0.4){\texttimes}10-5 eV2 and {\texttheta}=33.9+2.4-2.2 degrees.},

This paper describes the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm which is then used to perform the first systematic study of the potential of high granularity PFlow calorimetry. For simulated events in the ILD detector concept, a jet energy resolution of sigma\_E/E {$<$} 3.8 \% is achieved for 40-400 GeV jets. This result, which demonstrates that high granularity PFlow calorimetry can meet the challenging ILC jet energy resolution goals, does not depend strongly on the details of the Monte Carlo modelling of hadronic showers. The PandoraPFA algorithm is also used to investigate the general features of a collider detector optimised for high granularity PFlow calorimetry. Finally, a first study of the potential of high granularity PFlow calorimetry at a multi-TeV lepton collider, such as CLIC, is presented.},
