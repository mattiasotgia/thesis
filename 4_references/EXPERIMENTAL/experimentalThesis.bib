  abstract       = {The ICARUS collaboration employed the 760-ton T600 detector in a successful three-year physics run at the underground LNGS laboratory. In 2021, ICARUS started its new operation at Fermilab, collecting a substantial amount of neutrino events from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and the neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam off-axis. These were used to test the ICARUS event selection, reconstruction, and analysis algorithms. ICARUS successfully completed its commissioning phase in June 2022, moving then to data taking for neutrino oscillation physics, aiming at first to either confirm or refute the claim by the Neutrino-4 short-baseline reactor experiment. ICARUS will also perform measurements of neutrino cross sections in LAr with the NuMI beam and several Beyond Standard Model studies. After the first year of operations, ICARUS will search for evidence of sterile neutrinos jointly with the Short-Baseline Near Detector, within the Short-Baseline Neutrino program. In this work, preliminary results from the ICARUS data with the BNB and NuMI beams are presented, both in terms of the performance of all ICARUS subsystems and the capability to select and reconstruct neutrino events.},
